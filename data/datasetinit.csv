American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to ""disrupt
the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the
intervention deprived aI-Qaida of a sanctuary. But aI-Qaida — even after its
leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US. commandos — has spawned cells
elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is
rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question
is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the
mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should
review his military strategy without delay.Joih us! Veterans USA ( @veterans

A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this
acceptable?

We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.

One of the last things that Jonathan Sanders, an unarmed black man,
reportedly said before he died was, “Let me go. I can’t breathe.” On
Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,
Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a
flashlight before killing him in view of his family members.

Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a
flashlight, Sander’s attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.
Parrish |ater Clarified that those allegations came from family members who
witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced “some kind of

asphyxiation” during the altercation.
Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two Children.

The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe,"" the last words of
Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe, let me go"". Biting irony, isn't it?

The famous African-Amerioan writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a Child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.

People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.

What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That‘s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.

“Do black females lives matter, too?”

That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.

“Black features are beautiful, black women are hot,” Stenberg wrote. “White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.”

Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.

In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden
behind the mask of tolerance.",https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,1080,113,2015-07-15 03:35:13.000 -07:00,2015-07-17 03:35:13.000 -07:00,331.57,RUB,"Baltimore Maryland|Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri|Cleveland Ohio",,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a City park last November.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face Charges in the shooting.

Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a City recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.

By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

A teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.

This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.

His mother said that she respected the police and that her son “shouldn’t
have had the gun.” But from what witnesses have told her, she said, “They
didn’t have to shoot him down like that.”

One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.

When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun) - he'll be immediately shot by
the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then
here we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn’t afford to pay bail.

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other

Hide Evidence

A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating
bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in seIf-defense.

Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City
after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over
the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man “needs
a god damn bullet” and allegedly referred to him as “that nigger”, after
becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior
run-In.

The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret
recording of Middlebrooks’s remarks was played to the City’s police Chiefs
and the mayor. Elected City councillors said they were not consulted.

Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you
are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide
the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a

An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports
that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

And now there are three main points that you should think of:

1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.

2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.

3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one

to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes

Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjaoking

Yesterday night, a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.

According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 pm. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard, Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.

Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?

Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who
was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear.
What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to
death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell, who had a severe mental illness had
been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.

Ajudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a
mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to
eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health
crisis.

Autistic Teen Unconscious

During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line’s Lexington Parkway Station.

The teen suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.

Abrams non-compliance wasn’t done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Abrams’ autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

Officer Make Arrest

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for
declining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.

A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner
and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society.
They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that
they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and
has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday
racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government
along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of
force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression.

Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is
Challenging, but it‘s worth discrimination and unfairness black Civilians face
everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon
you have against police abuse and brutality.

The most famous Civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for
their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African-
Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa
Parks Changed our lives forever.

But what Changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater
equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you

20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and Children gathered on the
National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""

This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better
future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

317,,,,,Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community Colleg,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people’s
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn’t it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also
serves as the Chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission
and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington

appointed as a Chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official

Swedish, Czech, and German with ""traces"" of Native American heritage.

We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black
organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In
the Dolezal’s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated
fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community
in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.

We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal’s activities while she was a

to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.

Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government’s attitude

of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?

*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?

political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to

Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast,
Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on
CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when
it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""

""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with

racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.‘ We know he's president of all America

but white supremacy is American as Cherry pie.""

West is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no Choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks

Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of
America. Consequently, the victim‘s skin color plays a crucial role in deciding
what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if
the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots,
then they must think about the living standards of black population that is
several times below the living standards of white people in America. In
addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans.

shooting in Chattanooga, where a Kuwait-born terrorist killed five US Marines.
Hallinan announced his store’s new policy sitting against the Confederate
flag. The video posted in Facebook became popular.

What we can say? Hallinan is completely right! If the government cannot
provide our security, then we must do everything possible to provide it. A lot
of Muslims become Islamists, who pose a real threat to our national security.
We consider that it is really dangerous to sell arms to Muslims, as there’re a
lot of terrorists among them. The 2nd amendment was written for people, but
it doesn’t relieve people of responsibility.",https://www.faoebook.com/patriototus,603,100,2015-07-22 07:54:48.000 -07:00,2015-07-24 07:54:47.000 -07:00,164.49,RUB,,,People who like Being Patriotic|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.

This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It’s only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the
President of the United States.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!

Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend
the police from terrorists.",https://www.facebook.com/Being-PatriotiC-1601685693432389/,3362,761,2016-10-14 08:24:29.000 -07:00,2016-10-15 08:24:28.000 -07:00,500,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The US. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).

Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,

Military families has risen

US. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
copy of the alert said that the wife of a US. military member was approached
in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.

We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don’t fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and Children of the US. Military.
Secondly, families of the US. Military should be taken under special
protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the US. Military family
members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn’t worth a
dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a
negative scenario there won’t be any need in their work. And this will be the
final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.

Let’s remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the
Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the
other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept

actually be larger than 1.24 million.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.
Those who work illegaly don’t pay taxes that are an important part of state

budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.

Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.

You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can’t be the Tower of
Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We

made for self defense — it is a nation’s ability to overthrow the tyranny. A
Government that doesn’t trust its Citizens to possess weapons can never
receive mutual trust or respect. And that’s what things are now — there’s a
great mistrust between the people and the country Administration and the

who don't make an effort to learn and speak English?

Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.

Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez was shot and killed by police after he
attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tennessee and killed four US.
Marines at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve
Center. Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is
conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a
fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI
has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he
conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist
attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his
letter the terrorist didn’t refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own
volition.

We don’t want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam
have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the
Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to
become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on
their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more
seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam,

minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom

anything about David Duke... You’re asking me a question that I’m supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.”

However, “for some reasons” the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton’s ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of “surpassing eloquence and
nobility”. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying “It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can’t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

turned down because he's too big a liability.

In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, ""It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable.""

So what does the situation mean to America?

Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.

I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?

Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man.

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina’s
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK’s rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.

It is a very Clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional
heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand
against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.
The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The
government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we
should Clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn’t refuse
our history and our traditions.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,12,2,2015-07-22 05:14:56.000 -07:00,2015-07-24 05:14:56.000 -07:00,13.98,RUB,,,People who like Being Patriotic|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White
House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five
US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn’t ordered to lower
a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon
the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or
her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By
contrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn’t yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then
decided to kill in the name of Allah.

In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many
ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do

not even bother to learn English, because it’s enough to speak Spanish, has
increased.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,22,8,2015-07-21 07:21:41.000 -07:00,2015-07-23 07:21:40.000 -07:00,6.76,RUB,,,People who like Being Patriotic|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

And
it is becoming dangerous.

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.

“He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn’t worth anything now,”
Mark Wilson said.

When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it’s amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don’t want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If
somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
eliminate the party.

court’s preliminary ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to Choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled

off to jail.

For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she’s
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!

And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!

Taxpayers Spend $3.5 Million to Find Out Why Lesbians Are Fat
A US. Health and Human Services study to understand why lesbians are fat
has now cost taxpayers over $3.5 million to-date.

The study, “Sexual Orientation and Obesity: A Test of a Gendered
Biopsychosocial Model,” seeks to determine why there is a disparity in the
obesity rates between straight women and lesbian women and straight men
and gay men.

which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a number of protected
categories, including sexual orientation.

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved
allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major
step toward dismantling a policy that has caused deep rifts in the 105-year-old
organization.

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders
without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting’s longstanding
policy of Chartered organizations selecting their leaders.

The Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering
example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America’s most
important and recognizable Civic organizations.

are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay |eaders...This

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church.

One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots
after sharing his own version of the 1945 image.

The outrage was caused by artist’s artwork recreating iconic |wo Jima photo,
with a gay pride flag and haIf-naked men has received death threats. That’s a
bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don’t you think? What’s this, the
American version of Je suis Charlie?

Joe Rosenthal’s picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the
island of |wo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1945.

Around 70,000 US. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn’t a
fair fight back then, and it’s not a fairfight today. But there’s nothing
disrespectful in this image. Isn’t the imitation is the best form of homage?

They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.

It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be “broken” or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government’s crimes, and government really doesn’t like it, and

second, because she’s trans.

Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's Clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic Character.

But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?

Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning
forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had
been through enough already!

And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman’s touch :-)

Isn’t it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two
brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written

and illustrated by Jason Badower.
Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -

specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.

""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic Characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""

Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark

milestone in LBGTQ rights history.

Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
Change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her
superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)

Passing the “First Amendment Defense Act” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT oonservatives’ top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It’s part of the National
Organization for Marriage’s post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and
Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. In Oregon, judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by
Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing
service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of
Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to
serve a same-sex couple.

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges,
conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that
religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new
Claim about how these bakers’ “free speech” is under attack and how

they’re thus the real victims.

There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do
business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of

That's an enormous question, and it's one that eludes an answer.

Why there's so rarely we see acceptance, understanding, tolerance towards

I hope that someday all the hatred, all the xenophobia and prejudice between
us will ceased to exist.

most influential LGBT roles throughout his acting career.

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by
suicide on August 11 2014.

His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: “As he is
remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the
countless moments ofjoy and laughter he gave to millions.”

Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with
his trademark playfulness.

While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about
discussing the sexuality of his pet pug.

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very
modern.”

When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro-
LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital — one of Williams’ favourite Charities.

Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people’s lives, and

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players
spoke of killing gay people

Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014
Major League Baseball draft and given a Chance to pursue his dream of being
in the big leagues. But afterjust one season pitching for a Cardinals minor
league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during
his playing days, he was a Closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable
environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging
reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew
Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US.

For the first time, LGBTQ groups included in NYC’s St. Patrick’s parade

The nation’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade kicked off Thursday in New
York City, and for the first time in decades, gay activists are not decrying it as
an exercise in exclusion.

The first of roughly 200,000 marchers began striding up Fifth Avenue just
after 11 am. in a procession of throbbing pipes and drums, smiling dignitaries
and waving flags.

I’m gay.” For many
parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with

violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
“traditional marriage” or infringing on their religious liberty.

Yet in the months surrounding the recent US. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have

become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,

especially those who support marriage equality.

provoking.

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let’s hope that these changes“ ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

The 22-year-old Bangerz singer and 24-year-old Victoria's Secret model
Stella Maxwell have reportedly been dating since they met on Instagram in
April. While it's only been a few months, they're ready to take the next step.
Miley's told friends that Stella is the one. And she wants to make a huge
statement with an over—the-top wedding in the fall! She can't stop talking
about how in love she is and how she wants the whole world to know...

Miley came out as bisexual recently, not all of her relationships have been
“straight, heterosexual” ones. She also told Paper magazine how she came
out to her mom when she was 14, saying, ""I remember telling her I admire
women in a different way. And she asked me what that meant. And I said, 'I
love them. I love them like I love boys.""'

We hope Miley can move on from the wrecking balls and think about wedding

After eight years on the job, Margie V\ﬁnters was fired as director of religious
education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she’s
been married for all eight years.

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!

When students perceive that they’re not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it’s a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.

Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It’s very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at theirjobs. It’s
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!",https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/,2109,229,2015-07-10 05:36:04.000 -07:00,2015-07-11 05:36:03.000 -07:00,600,RUB,,,People who like LGBT United|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to LGBT United,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in

The pro wrestler Matt Cage, known as ‘Money’ publicly announced that he is
gay in a Facebook post. Previously Matt Hullum identified himself as bisexual.

Sorry, ladies. I'm officially pulling myself off of the market. Don't hate me too
bad.‘

'I truly have nothing to hide anymore,‘ he wrote. 'I spent the majority of my life
lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted
to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone
else, should have to do that.'

Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going
behind his back. This news should please all progressive humanity because
the coming-out once again confirms the fact that homosexuality and
masculinity are a perfect combination and do not contradict each other.",https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/,0,0,2015-06-24 07:15:12.000 -07:00,2015-06-25 07:15:12.000 -07:00,0,,,,People who like LGBT United|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to LGBT United,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

A San Francisco high school may be the first US school to offer an LGBT
studies course. The course will teach terminology and the history of LGBT
movement.

“We’ll look at what it’s been like for gay men, what it’s been like for lesbian
women, what it’s been like for transgender people,” Ruth Asawa High School
Social Studies teacher Lyndsey Schlax told. Schlax has been working with
Cleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk.

It is proposed that the Class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There
are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is
the fact that we need such Classes in every American school! Children
shouldn’t be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn’t be afraid to speak
about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or
transgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and
recognize them as ordinary Citizens.",https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/,118,3,2015-06-24 07:15:44.000 -07:00,2015-06-25 07:15:43.000 -07:00,42.94,RUB,,,People who like LGBT United|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to LGBT United,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

touches another person of the same gender for purposes of sexual
gratification be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient
method."" The act also will outlaw advocating gay rights to minors.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris Claimed that the proposal was
unconstitutional and it had no place in Civil society. The proposal reminds me
the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about
such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President?
Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal.

“Effective January 1, 2016, no carrier participating in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program may have a general exclusion of services, drugs or

supplies related to gender transition or ‘sex transformations,”’ the new
“carrier letter” said.

LGBT advocates who have been pressing the administration for Change
welcomed the news. “With today’s announcement, transgender federal
employees can now access health care that is so fundamental to their well-
being and, in the long-term, will make transgender employees happier and
more productive workers,” National Center for Transgender Equality
Executive Director Mara Keisling told.

so I have a lot of catching up to do,"" Jenner says. ""I feel such a responsibility
to this courageous group to try to get it right and tell all sides of the story. To
me, that's always the biggest question: am I doing it right?""

higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According
to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA
retirement benefit for legal Citizens is roughly $14,772.

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,2409,189,2017-05-16 07:32:20.000 -07:00,2017-05-17 07:32:20.000 -07:00,400,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

drawing our country into another regime Change venture. Our military
presence in Syria now doesn’t serve American interests. Our soldiers are
there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for
Americans. And that’s why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
opposite to the “America First” concept.

I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump’s presidency there are no Changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump’s influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he’s trying make a deal out of it,
but there’s one important thing here: under no Circumstances can our
soldiers’ lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said “let’s bring back our soldiers home”, and now it’s
really time to do it. This is not our war.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,2703,343,2017-05-23 07:06:22.000 -07:00,2017-05-24 12:30:00.000 -07:00,200,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

We’ve been watching our military
commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let’s hope it
will end now when Trump is in Charge.

A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for US.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.

We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that’s hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that’s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly
another oil war.

We’re fighting radical Islamists, but we’re also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there’s absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won’t replace ISIS when it’s gone.

There’s only one Chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American
nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do
now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,5186,502,2017-05-18 07:14:21.000 -07:00,2017-05-19 07:30:00.000 -07:00,500,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 � 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to
assist abandoned Children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew’s arrival in
Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by
authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these Children
stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the

police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside
the governor’s mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried
out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protesters were
arrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor’s home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

While Black activists are trying to strict American government’s attention by
organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
money into their banks.
A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
into BIack—owned banks in the last 5 days.
50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
from non-Black banks to BIack-owned institutions which would help to

Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of Chaos and
carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two Civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black US. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he Claimed he wanted to “kill white people”.

There’s no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There’s no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can’t show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is
a violent anti-government riot!

have turned into serial killers. The most annoying part is that they have
refused to release the footage video. They need retraining. Whatever
happened to Tasers? Whatever to rubber bullets? Whatever happened to
shooting shots in the sky as a warning? Why are police wearing body cam
and we can’t see it? If they’re right, let’s see it.

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person’s life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, “Sworn officer of the court” is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it’s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by

no time, “White Power” will be stronger than before.

the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver’s

Two beautiful and gifted young women were shot on Sunday in an apartment
complex parking lot near the LSU’s campus in Baton Rouge.

19 year old women were the Southern University Students.

Annette January was the freshman and a track start and the Lushantae
Benton was a sophomore and a highly regarded student-athlete trainer.

This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation’s
poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system
houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a
little on how it’s going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built
additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have
taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he
Chose prisons. It’s not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind

Anderson. Are they fucking kidding us? For them it’s enough and wealth it,
but to the family of Anderson it’s not better than the life taken. These guys
should pay a death penalty for taking a life. This is a racial act. Report says
between hits, they screamed, “White power!” before Dedmon ran him over,
causing fatal injuries. There is no particular reason for whatever they did so
America shouldn’t think they have done something much greater. “Money
cannot buy life,” that is what Bob Nesta Marley said and he is absolutely

Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband, Nicole Bennett has
built courage to take maternity photos with her 4-year-old son. She added old
photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a
spirit — a symbol of hope that he watches over them.
She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25.
We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these
photos.

you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have

The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it’s never been more
apparent that the US. government values white lives above all others. The

most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen

in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in
Philadelphia.

LITTLE BLACK BOY

The shocking video shows a Central Texas Child trying to get up from a bean
bag Chair in his Classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vahn pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small Child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: “Tell me no. When | tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.”

After the Burleson County Sheriff‘s Office launched an investigation, a
“behavior specialist” who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child
should be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,0,0,2016-10-20 07:56:03.000 -07:00,2016-10-21 07:56:02.000 -07:00,0,,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-American history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),24 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!",https://www.facebook.com/blacktivists/,53511,9633,2017-03-15 07:39:52.000 -07:00,2017-03-16 09:00:00.000 -07:00,400,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),18 � 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO

ARE YOU READY FOR A FLASH MOB, BLACKTIVISTS?

If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can‘t see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn‘t for us here before the elections, remember? If these

questions are asked more often, it will be another disappointing Election Day
for Hillary Clinton.

Take part in this flash mob and show everybody that no one can manipulate

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,36295,6656,2016-11-03 08:11:51.000 -07:00,2016-11-10 07:11:51.000 -08:00,500,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),16 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

Goodjob, Colin.",https://www.facebook.com/blacktivists/,16093,2102,2016-12-07 07:17:08.000 -08:00,2016-12-08 07:17:08.000 -08:00,400,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,34914,3640,2016-11-03 08:13:05.000 -07:00,2016-11-10 07:13:05.000 -08:00,500,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),16 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the
Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,
the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive

ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.,"US. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.

After the critics complained about the Army‘s unfair burden on black women‘s

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,48,27,2017-02-14 06:46:19.000 -08:00,2017-02-15 06:46:19.000 -08:00,200,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),18 � 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial
discrimination and were awarded $5.2 million are suing police department
again, Claiming they faced the same issues.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work, they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Ha|| received a “need improvement rating,” his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.

Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers
still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police
department despite the fact that we live in a “post-racial” society.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,22,1,2016-05-11 05:01:41.000 -07:00,2016-05-12 05:01:41.000 -07:00,4.75,RUB,Baltimore (+25 mi) Maryland,,,,,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),15 - 25,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

“The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,” said
Chicago—based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said “ Power concedes nothing except by a demand”. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.

It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was

have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million, with

For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those
killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation

THINGS
HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,54,6,2016-04-07 07:44:35.000 -07:00,2016-04-08 07:44:34.000 -07:00,51.87,RUB,,,People who like Blacktivist|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Blacktivist,,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing
terrorists only leads to more casualties among Civilians and creates even

more money for them and they don’t care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals

think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a
Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for
leaving Islam.

1428,,,,,A new disturbing dashcam video from May,"A new disturbing dashcam video from May 2013 is shining light on what
happened the night a Chicago.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-
Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper—sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat
zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another
attitude to people in blue?",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,18920,3093,2016-05-05 02:15:42.000 -07:00,2016-05-07 02:15:41.000 -07:00,500,RUB,,,People who like Don't Shoot|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Don't Shoot,,,,,,,,,,13 - 30,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that’s why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.

There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff’s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.

that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,

We found old dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas
trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase, leaped into
the air and karate kicked him to the ground.

The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran
trooper, took Chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near
Houston.

Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and
show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was
already surrendering off his motorcycle.

1569,,,,,What's the difference between USA cops a,"What's the difference between USA cops and EU cops?

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

Bad that America trained not like this!???",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,12013,1364,2016-08-10 04:40:12.000 -07:00,2016-08-11 04:40:10.000 -07:00,700,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,18 - 45,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That’s just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and screaming, “We’ll
make America great again! We’ll throw you out of the wall!”",https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/,380,58,2016-03-17 04:21:38.000 -07:00,2016-03-18 04:21:37.000 -07:00,100,RUB,,,People who like United Muslims of America|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to United Muslims of America,,,,,,,,,,18 - 45,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America",https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/,19055,2445,2016-03-18 07:59:40.000 -07:00,2016-03-21 07:59:39.000 -07:00,5500,RUB,,,,Humans of New York,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices P(1)0003699

The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be
filled.

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
accused of committing a felony.

Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
be filled.

Please help Mr. Khan’s family to raise enough money for all medical surgery

and hospital expenses.
If you are unable to help financially, we understand. Please share this

fundraising post with others so more people become aware! I believe -
together we can do this!

In this month of Ramadan we kindly ask everyone to keep Mohamed
Rasheed Khan in your prayers for his well being and a speedy recovery! Let‘s

help our fellow brother reunite with his family. InsAIIah!

us. Why? Because we want to live in a better future and Hillary is not the
person who will help us in getting justice and peace by all means!
Dear followers, if you agree, just don't be ignorant to your future in America,

join our flashmob and take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or

is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.
Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all

soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the
""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until

Our women are of the most beauty
and men of the most strength. American government and media try to
suppress the idea of Blacks being equal, I'm not even talking about being
better. We are better, we are tougher and we managed to pass through the
centuries of slavery and oppression! That's why we must stay together, cause
together we are power! United we stand, divided we fall! Join us! Black Pride (

up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of
today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child
is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people

1961,,,,,Illegal immigrant invasion is going at f,"Illegal immigrant invasion is going at full speed and drug cartels are their most
powerful weapon.

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. “It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that’s where the source of the
cocaine was,” special agent Tim Stone said.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government
officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get
filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only
hope for a better future!",https://www.facebook.com/Secured-Borders-757183957716200/,7,0,2016-06-07 00:12:18.000 -07:00,2016-06-08 00:12:17.000 -07:00,192.92,RUB,,New York,,,,,,,,,,,16 - 53,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man.

It's been a year since he died. Justice still hasn't been served.

strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more Civilians. Just to make it
Clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren’t destroyed in ’30 days’ and it seems like they
won’t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war ‘for freedom’, it’s
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict
can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.",https://www.facebook.com/bornliberall,1929,242,2017-05-16 07:40:03.000 -07:00,2017-05-18 07:40:03.000 -07:00,399.99,RUB,,,People who like Born Liberal|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Born Liberal,,,,,,,,,,35 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our

more money for their wars, and they don’t mind it if average Americans live in
poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our

of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,

2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in
the EPA’s budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it’s
a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-
powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative
energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want
thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use

every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria.

Serena said about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
about to make a new world record but she's already made history.

Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis
black. Never before the world had a Chance to admire black excellence on the

tennis court.

Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!
You made all of us great!

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don’t have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

It's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

today, in 2017.

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

with his illustrations is As Big As God.

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

past say. That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in
exchange for what they promise to give American Citizenship. In this regard,
Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from
where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as
today the process of obtaining American Citizenship can last for years and
even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming

two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an

Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and

began the deportation process.

era portrait

Apparently, the man’s main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
Charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.

It is not Clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.

Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how |ibera| propaganda
influences even on Southern people.

The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people’s respect.

It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect
our history and fight against |ibera| brainwashing.",https://www.facebook.com/South-United-1777037362551238/,118,18,2016-10-12 03:49:50.000 -07:00,2016-10-13 03:49:48.000 -07:00,100,RUB,,,,Confederate Flag|American Civil War reenactment,,,,,,,,,16 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are

some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had

been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/,0,0,2016-10-12 05:55:09.000 -07:00,2016-10-13 05:55:07.000 -07:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16 - 55,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios.’

That is what organizers of campaign say about it.

We say that it is very important for young Black people to be a part of our
community! And this camp will help them with that!

Young Blacks are educated and uplifted in rooms with walls full of art at this
camp. They have opportunity to learn our history! Black history!

By the way, this camp is supported by Colin Kaepernick!

Black people are powerful together!

If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself.
Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself.
I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you
won't Check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever Check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to Change.

the most political courage”. He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
was hated for not taking actions, but it’s better for being hated for not killing
innocent people that for starting a useless war.

Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
Unfortunately, the recent government didn’t think twice, before they started
bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill
innocent kids in Syria.

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always

was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.",https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-1195795607160174/,159,28,2016-10-12 03:18:17.000 -07:00,2016-10-13 03:18:15.000 -07:00,100,RUB,,,,Amenity|Jesus Daily,,,,,,,,,16 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.",https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-1195795607160174/,0,0,2016-10-17 02:14:28.000 -07:00,2016-10-13 03:18:15.000 -07:00,0,,,,,Amenity|Jesus Daily,,,,,,,,,18 - 45,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

On April 14 the Plummers’ door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather’s shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the soared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun b|ast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!

So what makes you want to be a part of this system, in other terms, be a
slave to this system?

Why in the heck would you all be routing and rioting and fighting over and for
a two-party government system that cares less about you?

Damn, we all agreed with Kaepernick when he took the knee for us all, and

Like wtf happened to we rising above the government system to improve our

Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

downtown Charleston.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that’s being displaced by development says he’s doing it to make a
statement.

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

I’m so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can
protect our history!",https://www.facebook.com/Black4BlaCk-1268698556482143/,2156,14,2016-12-27 06:20:34.000 -08:00,2016-12-28 06:20:34.000 -08:00,300,RUB,,,,Martin Luther King|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-American history|Malcolm X,,,,,,,,,18 - 65+,News Feed on desktop computers|Instagram Feed|News Feed on mobile devices

Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two
college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal
profession and went to law school right after his parole.

He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in Civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.

apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.

He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA’s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar’s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
