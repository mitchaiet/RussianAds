arrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor’s home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

We all say it's a whiteman's world in the US. with white-favouring-rules and
everything, right?
So what makes you want to be a part of this system, in other terms, be a
slave to this system?

Why in the heck would you all be routing and rioting and fighting over and for
a two-party government system that cares less about you?

Damn, we all agreed with Kaepernick when he took the knee for us all, and

the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.""

However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to
deport us from our indigenous land!",

Jacquelyn Gordon said that the Church was in the process of development

The famous African-Amerioan writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a Child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.

People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.

What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That‘s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.

One of the last things that Jonathan Sanders, an unarmed black man,
reportedly said before he died was, “Let me go. I can’t breathe.” On
Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,
Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a
flashlight before killing him in view of his family members.

Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a
flashlight, Sander’s attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.
Parrish |ater Clarified that those allegations came from family members who
witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced “some kind of

asphyxiation” during the altercation.
Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two Children.

The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe,"" the last words of
Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe, let me go"". Biting irony, isn't it?

debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this
acceptable?

We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.

The VWVII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was
not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and
ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher.

A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
decades. But about four years ago, he was taking care of his wife, who had
Alzheimer’s disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
$73,000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan
payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.

Why does the US. government treat military veterans absolutely
disgracefully? Why the VWVII veterans are literally being treated like human
garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was
evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among
American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the

A teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.

This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.

His mother said that she respected the police and that her son “shouldn’t
have had the gun.” But from what witnesses have told her, she said, “They
didn’t have to shoot him down like that.”

One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.

When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun) - he'll be immediately shot by
the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then
here we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a City park last November.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face Charges in the shooting.

Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a City recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.

By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use

“Do black females lives matter, too?”

That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.

“Black features are beautiful, black women are hot,” Stenberg wrote. “White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.”

Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.

In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden
behind the mask of tolerance.",

destroy this country. Our friends from San Diego organized a rally to support
ideas of Donald Trump. Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the
CIinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront
a very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the
Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy
America just to be elected.

We have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal
immigration around the whole country! Let's flood the United States with
American flags!

the air and karate kicked him to the ground.

The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran
trooper, took Chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near
Houston.

Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and
show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was
already surrendering off his motorcycle.

beliefs, we are all HUMANS.

In the midst of the presidential race, all what politicians dream about is
money. They keep giving empty promises in order to win votes. And this is
our friendly reminder for the candidates: we are the ones who elect them. We
don’t deserve having problems with employment, marriage, Child birth etc...
We all deserve the right to be accepted.

Go for it! Clicking the “like” button is not enough.
If you want to attract the candidates' attention to the fight for human rights, do

the following:

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.",

Despite our race, religion, gender, age, education, sexual orientation and
beliefs, we are all HUMANS.

In the midst of the presidential race, all what politicians dream about is
money. They keep giving empty promises in order to win votes. And this is
our friendly reminder for the candidates: we are the ones who elect them. We
don’t deserve having problems with employment, marriage, Child birth etc...
We all deserve the right to be accepted.

Go for it! Clicking the “like” button is not enough.
If you want to attract the candidates' attention to the fight for human rights, do

the following:
1) Take a picture with Campaign (HUMAN RIGHTS) logo (state required)

2) Post it in comments within a week
3) Share with your friends

For the first place $50; second place $30; third place $20",

Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and
a state’s attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there
was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him, even though
it was and Walker said that! It’s another prove that if you are black in this
country, you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison |itera||y for
the color of your skin.

Walker’s attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he
spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?!

They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.

It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be “broken” or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government’s crimes, and government really doesn’t like it, and

second, because she’s trans.

Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's Clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic Character.

But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?

Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning
forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had
been through enough already!

Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots
after sharing his own version of the 1945 image.

The outrage was caused by artist’s artwork recreating iconic |wo Jima photo,
with a gay pride flag and haIf-naked men has received death threats. That’s a
bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don’t you think? What’s this, the
American version of Je suis Charlie?

Joe Rosenthal’s picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the
island of |wo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1945.

Around 70,000 US. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn’t a
fair fight back then, and it’s not a fairfight today. But there’s nothing
disrespectful in this image. Isn’t the imitation is the best form of homage?

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let’s hope that these changes“ ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

Caitlyn accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards.

Caitlyn is amazing! It was her first public appearance since announcing her
decision to transition.

And her speech brought me to tears. It was very touching and thought
provoking.

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the
larger transgender community.

In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is
an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up
and do everything she has done and is doing.

It's estimated that over 134000 American veterans are transgender.
Not long ago these people were forced into hiding. As a result, many were
unable treatments for their gender dysphoria, a state of emotional distress
caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with

their gender identity.

Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you
and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong
friends, yourjob, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often
violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless

they have to do so.

Transphobio s|ur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike
Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are

still struggle for equal rights.
We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse

progressive Changes for their own benefit. We can’t let that happen!

These people know what it means to be Transgender and know what it is to
serve in our Armed Forces. We respect their opinion in both of these areas,
especially over those of Governor Huckabee who has not experienced or
accomplished either.

I’m gay.” For many
parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted

the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Comprehensive High School officials to remove the Old Glory from his
pickup? It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the
students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles.

The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against
High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest
that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious
people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks
on American values and Constitutional |aws.

Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these
attacks, and the liberals’ offensive and violent moods make it Clear — every
American patriot has to be careful and attentive.",

14 years ago America has Changed forever. One of the darkest days in
American history came. The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us.
Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the
terrorist attacks firsthand. RIP to all innocent victims, workers, police officers,
firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a clay in our history
that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of
the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11?

I'd like to tell you #My911Story.

l was only 15 when the attacks occurred. l was at school. I remember that
somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC.
We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom
called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I
remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took
responsibility for the attacks.

And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11?

October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the
Million Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,
Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.

There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
should live here legally; he should not break the law. lt’s justice.",

The shocking video shows a Central Texas Child trying to get up from a bean

employee, Troy Vahn pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small Child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: “Tell me no. When | tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.”

After the Burleson County Sheriff‘s Office launched an investigation, a
“behavior specialist” who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child
should be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.",

spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial
discrimination.

By recalling King’s vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive
and just community that does not retreat from diversity but draws strength
from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a
deepening political divisions in the country, King’s words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.

We’re coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American Civil rights leaders. Don’t forget to bring
your Children with you, because it’s important for them to know where they
come from and their rich history.

Join us on January 15! Let’s keep the dream alive! Martin Luther King Jr.

post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial
tensions in the USA. Moreover she Claimed that she is “almost to the point”
of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party
incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile.

“This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I’m
going to just go ahead and say it... .the blacks are the ones causing the
problems and this ‘racial tension. I guess that’s what happens when you
flunk out of school and have no education. I’m sure their parents are just as
guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn’t care,”
she wrote. She also added,“|’m almost to the point of wanting them all
segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the
innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something.

After eight years on the job, Margie Vﬁnters was fired as director of religious
education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she’s
been married for all eight years.

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!

When students perceive that they’re not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it’s a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.

Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It’s very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at theirjobs. It’s
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!",

We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black
organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In
the Dolezal’s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated
fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community
in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.

We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal’s activities while she was a

Throughout the twenty-first century there are thousands of complaints of the
police “profiling” black drivers in America. Black Americans often complaint
about being pulled over for the phenomenon called “driving while black”. For
example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped
hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black
man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers.

But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember
Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all
remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to
avoid traffic stops in order to survive?

For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the
people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers

While the birth mother was resting with the baby, Andy and his partner took a
break from the hospital to get some food. When they returned, they had a
flurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back
soon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay
couple adopt her baby.

”Aren’t you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren’t you afraid

that he’s not gonna grow up and be normal?” asked the nurse.

Excuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the
mother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up ""normal""? A
mother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption,

On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri City after
St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and
Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis
Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and
was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.

That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later
on, nine people were arrested on Charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if
this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why
do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the City and the
government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in
America instead of suspecting every single black men?

Tupac Shakur was indeed not just one of the greatest rappers of all time but a
worldly icon whose status in hip-hop culture can never be replaced. His
revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful
unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs
touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression,
etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn’t stand up
for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth.

Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell
records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too
corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary Citizens. On
the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That’s why he spoke
to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.

Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government’s attitude
towards Blacks. But let’s remember Tupac and his ability to question the
social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to Change

as the 14 officers took down the one-legged homeless man.

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

to death

Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool
party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party
at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager’s pool party which
ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of
the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager CIanton passed away on the
way to hospital.

In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.
Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware
of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?

Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the
tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the
easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the
shootings at the average pool party.",

On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel AME. Church opened its doors for
the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday,
thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and
solidarity.

Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to
create a ""unity chain,"" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes
in honor of the fallen.

Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday’s gathering,
according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in
the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted “Charleston
strong!”

Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when
they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only
imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons
to sorrow over something day by day.

Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant
fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans
unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it
does.",

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody

Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these
issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent.
Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be
targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers
the rights of black community.

Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black

White police officer slammed black teen against his
car

This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the
family‘s testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight
Children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.
Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of
the Children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon
walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an
ID-oard. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed
Dixon‘s family and grabbed 12-year-old Child by neck. But according to the
Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive
force.

Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race
factor? Don‘t you think the police officer‘s attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was
unlawful? How the police officers should be Charged? What kind of right of
defense do you have against unlawful arrests?

These days, there is far more to being a “good cop” than Choosing not to hurt
innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even
today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America
transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying.
White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of
criminals and |ooters. How are we going to live with that?",

*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?

Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on
CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when
it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""

""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with

racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.‘ We know he's president of all America

but white supremacy is American as Cherry pie.""

West is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no Choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks
from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just
count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The

murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse?

The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery
time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask
to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of
America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.
We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist
political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to
Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned
slaves on their farms.

Police officer Jeff Willis is facing disciplinary action after a video surfaced of
him violently threatening teenagers because they were smiling at him and not
taking him seriously enough. Willis pulled them over because one of the
passengers allegedly flipped him the middle fighter from the window.

When one of the young men asks the officer “What did I do?” the officer
responds by saying, “I don’t know. Ijust don’t like you, Ijust don’t like you.""

The only crime committed by the occupants of the car was shooting the video.
We have a legal right to film and photograph police, in every state! People
should know their rights - it's the first step to stop police brutality.

If another person smiling makes you that upset, you should not be permitted
to own a gun. People, who have mental illness or anger issues should not
having access to guns. Guns should be in the hands of responsible adults!

Police went out of the control. How much respect do you think Police has for
people? 0! In this way, if you can't control yourself it's time to retire, you don't
deserve to carry the badge.

America needs better gun control. Although, it's not the type of gun that is the
problem. It is the type of gun owner that is the problem. America, control your

A teen committed suicide in a jail cell an hour after being arrested, another
suspicious case of a Black woman dying in police custody in the past week.
The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by
Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we
are gonna buy such bullshit.

The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed
just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing
someone’s phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.
We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as
opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet.

It definitely seems like there’s more to this since until recently taking into
custody hasn’t been a reason for suicide among black women. Now for some

killing themselves...",

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn’t afford to pay bail.

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a
means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping
the very rich from ever being brought to justice.",

Last week, in a place that bills itself as the “Friendliest Town on the Eastern
Shore,” angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job
for Kelvin Sewell, the community’s first black police Chief.

On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of
departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to
voice their outrage to the Pooomoke City Council with posters that read ""We
Support Chief Kelvin Sewell.""

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina’s
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK’s rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.

It is a very Clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional
heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand

The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The
government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we
should Clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn’t refuse
our history and our traditions.",

Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

Last Saturday the 16-year-old Brandon Claxton prompted an officer to shoot
him three times in a housing complex in Hodiamont Avenue. According to
police, they responded to a call about someone with a stolen 40-Caliber pistol.
Brandon Claxton is in critical conditions.

But according to witnesses, Brandon did not point a pistol at anyone but he
was trying to run away from the officers.

Where is the video evidence of police shooting? Police Chief Sam Dotson
said that there is not a Clear view on video. What if police is trying to cover up
the story? Did you know that police did not allow Brandon’s mother to see
her son because he was in custody? Do you believe that police was justified
to arrest Brandon?

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved
allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major
step toward dismantling a policy that has caused deep rifts in the 105-year-old
organization.

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders
without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting’s longstanding
policy of Chartered organizations selecting their leaders.

The Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering
example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America’s most
important and recognizable Civic organizations.

This is a step in the right direction, but we’re still really concerned that there
are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay |eaders...This

Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjaoking
attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?

Yesterday night, a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.

According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 pm. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard, Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.

Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports

told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

And now there are three main points that you should think of:

1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.

2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.

3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one

to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes

doomed to disappointment?",

Hide Evidence

A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating
bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in seIf-defense.

Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City
after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over
the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man “needs
a god damn bullet” and allegedly referred to him as “that nigger”, after
becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior
run-In.

The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret
recording of Middlebrooks’s remarks was played to the City’s police Chiefs
and the mayor. Elected City councillors said they were not consulted.

Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you
are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide
the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a
wonderful state called Alabama! You know how it works here. Do you have

The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky Clerk’s request to
keep enforcing her “no marriage licenses” policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court’s preliminary ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to Choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled

off to jail.

For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she’s
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!

And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!

Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?

is wrong with you people!""

violence such as use of police officer body cameras, raciaI-bias training and
surplus of military equipment. However, there is more work to be done to
solve racial tensions in America.

The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside
connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the
government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the

refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief
Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the
Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell‘s dismissal he filed a
complaint on unequal employment opportunities Claiming he was paid less
than his white predecessors.

This is Circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts

treated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of

advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started
her Civil rights organization, the National Council of Negro Women.

died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting
some crab legs from a grocery store. Due to her bad health history she was
taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to

help.

According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to
Check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one Checked Tumer‘s cell for
more than two hours.

A total of five African-Amerioan women have been found dead in police
custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor Charges and
still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra
Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones
from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell
after being arrested by police officers.

Once again it raises questions about how black people are treated in police
custody. What if death in police custody is about excessive police force? Do
you realize that dozens of black people were found dead in the US?",

How should we talk to our

Children about how safely interact with police officers in order to protect
themselves?

Tina Carter—Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive.
The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a
minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don‘t supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it‘s a reality. What if

police officers will automatically assume that your Child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.

Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That‘s why it‘s important to instruct our Children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your Child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.
Remember, anything is better than dying.

Anyways, it‘s hard to believe that in 21st century black parents have to teach

their Children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for
training police officers?",

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people’s
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn’t it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and Children gathered on the
National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""

This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better
future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?",

Last time I checked US wasn’t involved in any wars or anti-terrorist
operations, at least officially. Well, then how come Detroit is no less
dangerous then (the City ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous
Cities)??

When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his
rearview mirror he Chose to proceed with caution since some people are
known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a we||-|it area
to pull over in. As a result, he was Charged with ‘fleeing’ police.

People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to
communicate with officers only in the we||-|it areas. And get Charged for that.
Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military
operations in the foreign countries, our country’s at war with its own Citizens

?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.

I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

Officer Make Arrest

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for
declining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.

A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

When you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that
you can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime.",

Autistic Teen Unconscious

During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line’s Lexington Parkway Station.

The teen suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.

Abrams non-compliance wasn’t done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Abrams’ autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they
prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything
else, including that of the citizens they allegedly “protect and serve.”",

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to Change.

Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper—sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat

these visas are for lesser-skilled and lower-paid workers and their dependents
who, because they are here on work-authorized visas, are added directly to
the same labor pool occupied by current unemployed jobseekers. Expressly
because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide
range of taxpayer—funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly
substitute these workers for Americans.

Improved border security would have no effect on the continued arrival of
these foreign workers, refugees, and permanent immigrants—because they
are all invited here by the federal government.

Obama swore an oath to uphold our Constitution and protect the American
people but he has done everything in his power to destroy us. In a short few

had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and
the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for
several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck
and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in
handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg
before she could go home.

This girl’s day was totally ruined because cops thought that she looked
suspicious. After they ILLEGALLY searched her vehicle, she couldn’t go.

This is what real terrorism looks like!",

powerful weapon.

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. “It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that’s where the source of the
cocaine was,” special agent Tim Stone said.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government
officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get
filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This

It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner
and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society.
They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that
they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and
has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday
racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government
along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of
force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression.

Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is
Challenging, but it‘s worth discrimination and unfairness black Civilians face
everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon
you have against police abuse and brutality.

The most famous Civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for
their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African-
Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa
Parks Changed our lives forever.

But what Changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater
equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you
ever protested in Civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black
Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression?

Americans have rights and one of them is the right to remain silent. We don't
have to answer your stupid interrogation questions. If we are speeding, tell us
we were stopped for speeding, issue the warning/summons and get the hell
out of our lives Nazis. Why did they escalate the situation? What for?

The best part of the video is when they say she had the right to remain silent.

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.",

In just an eight-hour span during the Fourth of July weekend, gun violence in
Chicago left three people dead and 27 wounded. Amari Brown, a 7-year-old
boy on the City's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities.

Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 pm Saturday and 4:45 am. Sunday.
Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and
down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other
relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire
outside a relative's home where Amari and other Children were playing, hitting
both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the Chest.

No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference
Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in.

How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every
American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body?

march was an intended peaceful march which was meant to bring peace and

While Black activists are trying to strict American government’s attention by
organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
money into their banks.
A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
into BIack—owned banks in the last 5 days.
50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
from non-Black banks to BIack-owned institutions which would help to
empower and advance Black community.
The best way to fight the system is to break its capitalist back which is why it
is important for Blacks to invest in ourselves!",

The pro wrestler Matt Cage, known as ‘Money’ publicly announced that he is
gay in a Facebook post. Previously Matt Hullum identified himself as bisexual.

Sorry, ladies. I'm officially pulling myself off of the market. Don't hate me too
bad.‘

'I truly have nothing to hide anymore,‘ he wrote. 'I spent the majority of my life
lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted
to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone
else, should have to do that.'

Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going
behind his back. This news should please all progressive humanity because
the coming-out once again confirms the fact that homosexuality and
masculinity are a perfect combination and do not contradict each other.",

Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who
was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear.
What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to
death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell, who had a severe mental illness had
been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.

Ajudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a
mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to
eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health
crisis.

?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.

I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

won't Check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever Check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your

love yourself and heal your illness. ?

What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order
our country to live in peace?

The criminal justice system is very important institution where law
enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed
perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if
American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a
renewed sense ofjustice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main
Challenge of the criminal justice system?

Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of
America. Consequently, the victim‘s skin color plays a crucial role in deciding
what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if
the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots,
then they must think about the living standards of black population that is
several times below the living standards of white people in America. In
addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black
population by revising the hiring policy for black AmericansTherefore, if we
want a life‘s balance, the government have to reconsider all these things,
because Black Americans lives matter.",

strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more Civilians. Just to make it
Clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren’t destroyed in ’30 days’ and it seems like they
won’t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war ‘for freedom’, it’s
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict
can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.",

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.",

Passing the “First Amendment Defense Act” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT oonservatives’ top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It’s part of the National
Organization for Marriage’s post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that
we have full Federal Civil rights now. Or don't! We will go on happily living our
lives while you froth at the mouth and throw a fit because we're being treated

ARE YOU READY FOR A FLASH MOB, BLACKTIVISTS?

If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can‘t see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn‘t for us here before the elections, remember? If these

questions are asked more often, it will be another disappointing Election Day
for Hillary Clinton.

Take part in this flash mob and show everybody that no one can manipulate
black voters.

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

“The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,” said
Chicago—based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said “ Power concedes nothing except by a demand”. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.

It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

Join the Movement! 10-10-15

‘My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and
the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.’ Just 90 miles, but at the
same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba.

The poet added he hopes there’s still possible to achieve “healing” between
the two countries.

‘This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so
surreal sti||...This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new
things to come.’

It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba,
country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country
abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of
these conflicts... And there’s more - severe economic crisis, socialist
dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.",

members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

today, in 2017.

His mother discovered Leon’s talent when
he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

with his illustrations is As Big As God.

That’s what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon’s mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

foster care come from heterosexual families. So I think the straights should be

continue to allow qualified single adults to serve as foster parents for abused

and neglected Children, but she said her agency isn’t ready to say whether it
will allow married same-sex couples to do so.

Oh God... Just because your gay doesn't make you any less of a human or
any less deserving of any right afforded to anyone else! Anyone who believes
that a gay person is below a straight person needs treatment!

Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial
discrimination and were awarded $5.2 million are suing police department
again, Claiming they faced the same issues.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work, they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Ha|| received a “need improvement rating,” his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.

Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers
still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police
department despite the fact that we live in a “post-racial” society.",

CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change hisher
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

downtown Charleston.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that’s being displaced by development says he’s doing it to make a
statement.

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are

some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had

been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.

There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20

Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.
Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff’s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

SHOCKING video was uploaded to YouTube recently shows a man in
Newington, Connecticut, refusing to fall for Police State tactics of intimidation
at a police Checkpoint - widely known as a sobriety or DUI Checkpoint, but in
reality what amounts to an excuse for cops to surveil and keep tabs on
Citizens.

They say cops are keeping us safe, but the reality is absolutely different!
Those pigs are filling up prison for profit quotas, arrest quotas, any other
f@cking quotas. REMEMBER: Police is not a guarantee of peaceful streets...
not in the police states of America.

Moral of the story: educate yourself, stand up for your constitutional rights and
take the power back from these public ""servants.""#PowerToThePeopIe. We

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

On April 14 the Plummers’ door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather’s shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the soared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun b|ast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving

across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at
which point, he drove off.

He added that the man “wasn’t resisting at all until they tased him”

After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay
on the ground, screaming for help.

The man was heard screaming in pain: “My fucking back is killing me! Oh
god! My back!”
In a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department

confirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers’
conduct was justified.",

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.

—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",
