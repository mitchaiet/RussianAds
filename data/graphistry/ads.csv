A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent

nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,

The famous African-Amerioan writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West

Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.

People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.

What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,

That‚Äòs why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black

Last week, in a place that bills itself as the ‚ÄúFriendliest Town on the Eastern
Shore,‚Äù angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job
for Kelvin Sewell, the community‚Äôs first black police Chief.

On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of
departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to
voice their outrage to the Pooomoke City Council with posters that read ""We

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor Charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'Cause they
couldn‚Äôt afford to pay bail.

Under the City‚Äôs new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports

told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken

317,,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people‚Äôs
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn‚Äôt it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it

Casebolt's decision to leave was voluntary and that he would continue to
collect a pension and benefits.

Why are the police so aggressive? It's in every state around the country. The
young girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police,
good police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need
someone who will protect us from the police. At the same time, it is good that
millions of regular people got a glimpse of what kind of policing minorities
have endured for decades.",2woxotpgdvlkh,RussianAD,357,McKinney Police Officer Involved In Pool,https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,559,12,2015-06-10,2015-06-11,85.25,RUB,"Baltimore Maryland|Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri|Cleveland Ohio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

359,,"Police Charges Black Student For Driving To A WeII-Iit Area

Last time I checked US wasn‚Äôt involved in any wars or anti-terrorist
operations, at least officially. Well, then how come Detroit is no less
dangerous then (the City ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous
Cities)??

When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his
rearview mirror he Chose to proceed with caution since some people are
known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a we||-|it area
to pull over in. As a result, he was Charged with ‚Äòfleeing‚Äô police.

People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to
communicate with officers only in the we||-|it areas. And get Charged for that.
Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military
operations in the foreign countries, our country‚Äôs at war with its own Citizens
with the help of police.",2woxotpgdvlkl,RussianAD,359,Police Charges Black Student For Driving,https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,1078,139,2015-07-10,2015-07-12,180.82,RUB,"Baltimore Maryland|Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri|Cleveland Ohio",,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with

racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.‚Äò We know he's president of all America

West is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no Choice. Cornel is a good leader, he

boy on the City's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities.

Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 pm Saturday and 4:45 am. Sunday.
Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and
down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other
relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire
outside a relative's home where Amari and other Children were playing, hitting
both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the Chest.

No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference
Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in.

what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if

several times below the living standards of white people in America. In

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black

xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we

Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last

the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate

percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect ‚Äî a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote ‚Äî not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto ‚Äî and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42

On August 11, 1972 the last US ground combat unit left South Vietnam. Direct
US. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. The government spent
more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the
widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had
pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation.
Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the
war and its supporters.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.
Those who work illegaly don‚Äôt pay taxes that are an important part of state

budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.

Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.

You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can‚Äôt be the Tower of

14 years ago America has Changed forever. One of the darkest days in
American history came. The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us.
Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the
terrorist attacks firsthand. RIP to all innocent victims, workers, police officers,
firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a clay in our history
that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of
the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11?

I'd like to tell you #My911Story.

l was only 15 when the attacks occurred. l was at school. I remember that
somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC.
We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom
called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I
remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took
responsibility for the attacks.

And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11?

Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and

against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White

a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon

as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn‚Äôt yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then

flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and

Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain‚Äôs southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family‚Äôs request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican‚Äôs reasoning for rejecting Salinas‚Äô wish.

It said transsexual behavior ‚Äúreveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one‚Äôs own sexuality.‚Äù

allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change hisher

parents first reaction probably will be ‚ÄúHow will I ever handle this?‚Äù The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child‚Äôs sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child‚Äôs sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free ‚Äî overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening ‚Äî by rejecting what they're
hearing (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a phase; you‚Äôll get over it‚Äù); by shutting down (‚ÄúIf you
Choose that lifestyle, I don‚Äôt want to hear about it‚Äù); or by not registering the
impact of what we‚Äôre being told (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?‚Äù).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child‚Äôs sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child‚Äôs sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with

Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you

violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless

Caitlyn is amazing! It was her first public appearance since announcing her

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the

In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is

Let‚Äôs meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary

But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He‚Äôs astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

America's military progressing s|ow|y towards inclusion and equal opportunity.

They are banding together to question and redefine what it means to be queer

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let‚Äôs take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That‚Äôs just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don‚Äôt stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ‚Äúwork to overturn
any Supreme Court decision‚Äù in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn‚Äôt qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen ‚Äî and it already has in some states ‚Äî
so it‚Äôs a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there‚Äôll be NO MORE of it!

There‚Äôs a part of me that feels very sad for NOM‚Äôs fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they‚Äôll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life‚Äôs Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone‚Äôs life better. At all.

They didn‚Äôt win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they‚Äôre dead and gone, they‚Äôll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history ‚Äî or more likely they ‚Äòll be forgotten completely.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going into Syria‚Äù, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here‚Äôs what Ron Paul thinks about it: ‚ÄúBy the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board ‚Äî or replace them. There
is no way another ‚Äúsurge‚Äù in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.‚Äù

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We‚Äôve started the whole Afghanistan

arrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor‚Äôs home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without

It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, ‚ÄúSworn officer of the court‚Äù is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it‚Äôs a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system

additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher

shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: ‚ÄúTell me no. When | tell you to

After the Burleson County Sheriff‚Äòs Office launched an investigation, a
‚Äúbehavior specialist‚Äù who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the

student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‚Äòt have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‚Äòs attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‚Äòs defense attorney‚Äòs:

‚ÄúThe doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.‚Äù

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‚Äòs
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‚Äòs video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‚Äòve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‚Äòs why today it‚Äòs important to send a message to

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
‚ÄúChapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures‚Äù which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,‚Äù he said.

is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‚Äòt really care
about haters.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor‚ÄîUCLA Medical Center

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to

ignoring it can take away years of people‚Äòs lives.

April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.

caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.

‚ÄúThe Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and

Chicago‚Äîbased Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said ‚Äú Power concedes nothing except by a demand‚Äù. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the

killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation

HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a ‚Äúmedical episode‚Äù at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‚Äòs wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‚Äòt slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‚Äòs standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ‚Äúfighting‚Äù with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.",2woxotpgdvku1,RussianAD,1237,ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUS,https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,54,6,2016-04-07,2016-04-08,51.87,RUB,,,People who like Blacktivist|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Blacktivist,,,,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchaiet/RussianAds/master/cropped_images/1237.png,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umd-mith/irads/master/site/images/1237.png,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchaiet/RussianAds/master/cropped_images/1237.png

by an array of issues that we have to deal on a daily basis. Watching
America‚Äôs reaction to racism is very telling. Last year, police brutality and

1428,,"A new disturbing dashcam video from May 2013 is shining light on what
happened the night a Chicago.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-
Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper‚Äîsprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat
zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another
attitude to people in blue?",2woxotpgdvka9,RussianAD,1428,A new disturbing dashcam video from May,https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,18920,3093,2016-05-05,2016-05-07,500,RUB,,,People who like Don't Shoot|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Don't Shoot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1491,,"Horrifying video shows inmate being shocked three times with a stun gun

Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that‚Äôs why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.

There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in
prison for murder.

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff‚Äôs office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That‚Äôs just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama‚Äôs car and approaching Usama‚Äôs friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend ‚Äúbrown trash‚Äù and told him he had to ‚Äúleave this
country,‚Äù

According to Usama‚Äôs account, his friend responded: ‚ÄúThis is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?‚Äù

The incident ‚Äúescalated really quick,‚Äù with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting ‚ÄúTrump! Trump! Trump!‚Äù and screaming, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll
make America great again!

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America",2woxotpgdvknk,RussianAD,1640,An Open Letter to Hillary Clinton:,https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/,19055,2445,2016-03-18,2016-03-21,5500,RUB,,,,Humans of New York,,,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchaiet/RussianAds/master/cropped_images/1640.png,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umd-mith/irads/master/site/images/1640.png,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchaiet/RussianAds/master/cropped_images/1640.png

unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.

makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

Police Brutality. The day when everyone must stand up for their rights in the
City where ""We can't breath"" movement was created after Eric Garner's death.

Mr. Garner and his family paid a horrible price to make us all realize that
we're in danger. Eric will never be forgotten. The crimes of police officers will
never be forgotten as well. Police brutality in this country is unacceptable and
must be stopped!

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn‚Äôt Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don‚Äôt have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

Sincerely,

Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt

It's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn‚Äôt forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people‚Äôs love.
That‚Äôs cool that this love goes back and forth!

We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.‚Äù
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for ‚Äúcommunications within the diaspora,‚Äù and the
spear symbolizes ‚Äúwhatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.‚Äù

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver‚Äôs Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

Apparently, the man‚Äôs main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
Charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.

It is not Clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.

Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how |ibera| propaganda
influences even on Southern people.

The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people‚Äôs respect.

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans‚Äô issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans‚Äô life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are

some real Clinton decisions:

‚ÄîLast year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had

been exaggerated by Republicans.
‚ÄîIn 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans‚Äô

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans‚Äô health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for ‚Äú$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.‚Äù

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

raises these concerns.

If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself.
Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself.
I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you
won't Check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever Check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way‚Äù to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to Change.

before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off ‚Äî who she believed was a Chicago police officer ‚Äî stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ‚Äúhe just started
shooting,‚Äù hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

‚ÄúI was hoping my brother wasn‚Äôt dead,‚Äù said Boxley.

Beal‚Äôs mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2‚Äîyear-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

‚ÄúThis is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,‚Äù - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

into being homeschooled. He excels in Math, Foreign Languages, History,
Philosophy, IT and Science.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that‚Äôs being displaced by development says he‚Äôs doing it to make a
statement.

‚ÄúIt was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that‚Äôs not done here by black folk,‚Äù said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. ‚ÄúNone of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.‚Äù

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can‚Äôt be torn down!
