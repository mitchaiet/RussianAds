Donald Trump and his ilk are running the country. The latest effort by a GOP candidate: make Americans and North Carolinians dumber by eliminating the Department of Education (DOE).” Although this story is highly biased against the right it is properly sourced.

It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel; however, by April 2016, a CNN executive officially described the channel as “no longer a TV news network” and instead as “a 24-hour global multi-platform network.” CNN has multiple international stations covering all regions of the world. They have been inaccurately criticized as being fake news by President Trump and many of his supporters.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Cable News Network is owned by the Turner Broadcasting System (AT&T – Time Warner). The television stations and website is funded through cable subscriptions and an advertising model.\nAnalysis / Bias\nCNN has a left bias in story selection that often favors the left while being critical of the right. For example, during the 2016 Presidential Election Pew Research concluded that the majority of CNN stories covering President Donald Trump were negative. While less dramatic, Pew also determined that more stories were negative toward Presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.\nCNN typically utilizes loaded emotional words in sensational headlines such as this: Trump pounces on Justice Department report findings. They usually source their news properly through credible reporters/journalists and through hyperlinking to credible media sources. However, CNN has failed numerous fact checks from Politifact. It should be noted that these fact checks were almost exclusively from guests on their numerous talk shows and not from the reporting of actual news, which tends to be factual. TV hosts have also failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Further, CNN has retracted published stories that have been deemed as lacking evidence. Finally, CNN has published misleading information regarding GMO’s that utilize loaded fear based headlines such as this: FDA allows genetically engineered ‘Frankenfish’ salmon to be imported to US. CNN has also utilized known purveyors of pseudoscience as experts on discussion panels such as the Food Babe.\nOverall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left. We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits. However, CNN’s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting.

In reviewing fact checks we could not find any instance where EI directly failed a fact check from major fact checking sources. We did however find a case where EI refuted a pants on fire claim from Politifact that stated the Baltimore police were trained by Mossad. In their rebuttle, EI is careful to indicate that Mossad did not directly train the Baltimore Police, however they refute that there are not connections based on the defensive style they were trained in and the fact the police had visited Israel twice for training. In the end, Politifact is correct that it is unproven Mossad trained the Baltimore Police, but EI makes a compelling, well sourced rebuttal that there are connections to Israel. The issue with this exchange is the misleading headline used by EI: PolitiFact denies Israeli ties to Baltimore police despite evidence. Politifact’s fact check did not ask if there were Israeli ties, it centered purely on Mossad. Based on this misleading headline, I would rate EI as somewhat mixed for factual reporting despite the use of excellent sourcing in most articles and left biased based on story selection and wording that sometimes amounts to propaganda .

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1978 by Anne Nicol Gaylor, the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) is an American non-profit organization based in Madison, Wisconsin with members from all 50 states. The largest national organization advocating for non-theists, FFRF promotes the separation of church and state and educates the public on matters relating to atheism, agnosticism, and nontheism. \nIn March 2011, FFRF, along with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, began The Clergy Project, a confidential on-line community that supports clergy as they leave their faith. In 2012, it gave its first Freedom From Religion Foundation and Clergy Project “Hardship Grant” to Jerry DeWitt, a former pastor who left the ministry to join the atheist movement.\nIn June 2013 FFRF announced that, along with the Secular Student Alliance, it would work on educating students on their religious rights and would assist with rectifying violations and what they have termed “religious infringement into public education”.\nIn 2015, FFRF announced Nonbelief Relief, a new charitable arm. Nonbelief Relief is a humanitarian agency for atheists, agnostics, freethinkers and their supporters “to improve this world, our only world”. Nonbelief Relief seeks to remediate conditions of human suffering and injustice on a global scale, whether the result of natural disasters, human actions or adherence to religious dogma.\nThe FFRF also gives out the the Emperor Has No clothes award which is in recognition of “plain speaking” on the shortcomings of religion by public figures. Some past winners are George Carlin, Richard Dawkins, Ron Reagan, Christopher Hitchens, and Cenk Uygur.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe FFRF is considered a 501(c)(3) educational organization. Charity Navigator gives FFRF a four out of four star rating or 95%, which means the money they collect goes to the proper causes they support. Funding comes from donations. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, ‘the Foundation acts on countless violations of separation of state and church on behalf of members and the public, including: prayers in public schools, payment of public funds for religious purposes, government funding of pervasively sectarian institutions, and the ongoing campaign against civil rights for women, gays and lesbians led by churches.” Headlines and wording of articles on the website utilize moderately loaded words such as this: 46 years post-Roe, right to choice remains under attack. Within the body of this non-sourced article is more loaded language such as this: “The scary truth, however, is that the Religious Right has been steadily engineering rollbacks on Roe v. Wade even before Kavanaugh’s ascension, infiltrating state legislatures and governorships to incrementally strip away women’s access to abortion care.” In another article, Tennessee governor-elect already flouting Constitution, pandering to Religious Right, there is again a complete lack of sourcing information. Although it took several attempts, we did find an article that was sourced to the credible Des Moines Register. Bottom line is FFRF may be publishing factual information, but without sourcing the reader does not know and therefore we have no choice but to rate them Mixed for factual reporting. See Methodology.\nStory selection and policy issues almost always favors the left as this is a secular organization opposed to conservative christian ideology. \nA factual search reveals a half true claim.\nOverall, we rate the FFRF Left biased based on political positions and story selection that consistently favors the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor or zero sourcing of information.

In fact, most information on this website is not sourced or comes from transcripts or video links from hosts such as Thom Hartmann, who has made false claims in the past.

In North America, it comes out as a weekly newspaper. \nHaaretz was launched in British Palestine by the British army, in 1918 and in 1919 they were bought by Zionist leader and philanthropist Yitzhak Leib Goldberg. Haaretz was initially named Hadashot Me’Haaretz (“News of the Land”), later the name became Haaretz (“The Land”).\nThe paper and website focuses on news, economy, business, culture and entertainment, as well as international affairs across Israel and the Middle East region. Currently, the editor-in-chief is Aluf Benn and the publisher is the third generation of his family, Amos Schocken. Guy Rolnik is deputy publisher and founder of TheMarker (Israeli media organization). Rami Guez is the CEO of Haaretz Group. For complete list of Haaretz Group Management, please see here.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to the Financial Times, Haaretz does not report its earnings. They were also the first Israeli paper to introduce the paywall. For subscription fees please see here. \nRegarding ownership, In 1935, German Jewish businessman Salman Z. Schocken bought Haaretz. From 1939 to 1990 the publisher and editor was Gershom Schocken. In 2006, a 25% stake was sold to German publisher M. DuMont Schauber. In 2011, Russian-Israeli businessman Leonid Nevzlin acquired a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group. The Schocken’ family still owns 60% of its shares and controlling interest in the paper.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Haaretz is known to have a liberal editorial stance.  In 2017, however, they were also criticized by the left. For example, they published an op-ed which was titled “’religious Zionists’ are more dangerous to Israel than Hezbollah”, which caused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as the left of center labor party to denounce the article. Haaretz often has been critical of Benjamin Netanyahu’s center-right government, such as in these editorials titled “Israel’s Snap Election Is a Makeup Exam for Democracy” and “Give Someone Else a Chance.”  When it comes to sourcing, they often hyperlink to themselves or uses quotes, they also republish Reuters and Associated Press articles.\nWhen covering world news pertaining to the USA, they use loaded language in their headlines such as “Trump’s Peace Plan Could Be Called ‘Unexecutable,’ Pompeo Tells Jewish Leaders.” Opinion pieces regarding the USA tend to lean left with members of the Trump administration portrayed negatively though strong language such as this: Opinion Jared Kushner Just Killed the Palestinian Peace Camp. In general, Haaretz reports factual news with strongly left leaning editorials.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Haaretz Left biased based on story selection and editorial positions that strongly favor the Left and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

The Huffington Post was founded by Andrew Breitbart (Founder of Breitbart), Arianna Huffington (Former Executive Vice President of AOL Time Warner and Chairman of Betaworks and BuzzFeed), Kenneth Lerer (Chairman of Buzzfeed), and Jonah Peretti (CEO of BuzzFeed).\nIn March 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for $315 million and Arianna Huffington was named as president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, which included AOL properties such as Engadget and MapQuest. In 2015, Verizon bought AOL and the Huffington Post became part of Verizon. In 2016, Arianna Huffington resigned as editor-in-chief and former New York Times Johannesburg Bureau Chief Lydia Polgreen became editor-in-chief. In 2017, The Huffington Post name was shortened to HuffPost.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe HuffPost is currently owned by Oath Inc., which is a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nPolitico reports, that during the 2016 presidential elections, every article related to Donald Trump included a note at the bottom indicating Trump as being “racist”, “xenophobe”, “Misogynist”, however, after the election, HuffPost dropped the note.\nIn review, HuffPost publishes stories with strong emotionally loaded headlines such as “Comey Flips: ‘Vote for Democrats This Fall’” and “Trump Calls Female Reporter ‘So Obnoxious,’ Tells Her To Be Quiet.” HuffPost utilizes credible sources such as CBS News, New York Times, Politico, as well as blogs that are not known to us such as queensjewelvault.blogspot.com. Furthermore, HuffPost sources the Associated Press when covering world news such as “Mass Graves Suggest Systematic Killing Of Rohingya In Myanmar.” In general, a review of articles shows that more favor the left than the right.\nA factual search reveals that HuffPost had a failed fact check in the past, but promptly removed the article when it was discovered. They also published an Unproven Claim that was not corrected. Given that they corrected a false claim they earn High for factual reporting.\nOverall, we rate HuffPost Left-Biased due to story selection that favors the left and factually High due to proper sourcing of information. (5/13/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 6/19/2019)",

Moon Of Alabama states it purpose as “to discuss politics, economics, philosophy and blogger Billmon’s Whiskey Bar writings.” A Daily Kos article describes Blogger Billmon (pseudonym) as one of the earliest and leading guest bloggers of Daily Kos and a self admitted financial writer working for a big Wall Street firm. \nFunded by / Ownership\nThe editor and the person who runs the blog is anonymous and the about page states that “Bernhard started and still runs the site and you can reach the current administrator of this site by emailing Bernhard at MoonofA_at_aol.com (replacing _at_ with @).” Moon of Alabama does not have advertising, but they do have a donate button, so we assume this is the primary method of funding.\nAnalysis/ Bias\nMoon of Alabama looks at the issues from progressive perspective, for example this article describes Trump cabinet as follows: “Soon Netanyahoo will have the cabinet in place in DC he always dreamed of. A hawkish Pompeo at State, a real torturer as head of the CIA and now Bolton are already sufficient to protect Israel’s further expansion” The majority of blog posts utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as “Trump Asks Russia To Roll Over – It Won’t” and “John Bolton Wants No Deal With North Korea Or Iran – But Is There Any Other Choice?”   \nMoon of Alabama utilizes factually mixed sources such as RT News, Fox News, as well as credible sources such as Bloomberg, NY Times, Haaretz, The Jerusalem Post,  Politico, cisac.fsi.stanford.edu and blogs such as johnhelmer.org. Generally, all information is sourced properly with hyperlinks to mostly known media sources.\nOverall, we rate Moon of Alabama Left Biased based on story selection and word choices that consistently favor progressives and Mixed factually due to anonymity associated with who runs the site. Otherwise, Moon of Alabama is well sourced to credible/factual information. (M. Huitsing 6/6/2018)",

According to their about page “For over 100 years, we have championed progressive ideas and challenged popular opinion. Our vision for today revitalizes our founding mission for our new time. The New Republic promotes novel solutions for today’s most critical issues.

In fact, all information reviewed on this website it properly sourced to credible media outlets.\nEditorially, Rabble presents a progressive left bias with advocacy for the Environment, Feminism, Civil Liberties, Anti-Racism and LGBTIQ. In general, story selection favors the Left, which should not be surprising, as they freely disclaim they are a progressive source.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker.\nOverall, we rate Rabble.ca Left Biased based on story selection that favors the left, as well as advocacy for progressive political causes. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to use of proper sources and a clean fact check record. (F. Locke Siewert 2/11/2017) Updated (4/19/2019)",

         "notes":"History\nLaunched in 1971, The Southern Poverty Law Center (The SPLC) is a legal advocacy group that reports on inequality, litigating and tracking hate groups across the United States. According to their  history page they describe their founding purpose as a “civil rights law practice that would provide a voice for the disenfranchised.” They state their accomplishments over the years as “dismantled vestiges of Jim Crow, reformed juvenile justice practices, shattered barriers to equality for women, children, the LGBT community and the disabled, protected low-wage immigrant workers from exploitation, and more.” Joseph J. Levin, Jr is the co-founder, and the other co-founder Morris Dees was fired (March 2019), and his biography was removed from its website. Bryan Fair is the chairman and the SPLC is headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama, USA.\nIn summary, during the 1980s, The Southern Poverty Law Center began monitoring, tracking and exposing a wide variety of hate and extremist organizations including white supremacists and The Klan. In the 1990s, the SPLC launched the Teaching Tolerance program to provide educators with free, anti-bias classroom resources such as classroom documentaries and lesson plans. \nThe issues covered by the group are listed as “Hate & Extremism, Children’s Rights, Immigrant Justice, LGBT Rights, Economic Justice, Criminal Justice Reform, and Voting Rights.” They also have a section called Hatewatch, which is a blog that monitors and exposes the activities of the “American radical right.” SPLC has published an annual census of hate groups operating within the United States, through their hate map. The SPLC states they use a variety of methodologies to determine the activities of groups and individuals. These include “reviewing hate group publications and reports by citizens, law enforcement, field sources and the news media, and conducting our own investigations.” The hate map depicts the approximate locations of hate group chapters such as racist and anti-Semitic organizations.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center’s work is supported primarily through donors contributions and they don’t receive government funds. However, they don’t list their donors according to Charity Navigator. The Southern Poverty Law Center provides Audited Financial Statements, which provides their most recent financial information, as well as IRS Form 990. You can view the detailed financial reports here. The Southern Poverty Law Center also has various donation options. The Board members list can be found here.\nAnalysis / Bias\nOn March 29, 2019, The Southern Poverty Law Center (The SPLC) had an internal conflict, resulting in co-founder Morris Dees being dismissed after current and former employees filed complaints, including sexual harassment and a lack of diversity based on race and gender. The incident was covered by media including CNN and Fox News who reported on the incident. The SLPC has also been criticized by the far right Christian Family Research Council as “using smear tactics, intimidation, ritualized defamation, and a knack for fundraising to silence its political opponents” The Family Research Council (FRC) is designated as an anti-LGBTQ hate group. \nAs well as exposing the activities of the American radical right, and white supremacist, the Southern Poverty Law Center also designated radical groups such as “The New Black Panther Party” (not to be confused with the Black Panther Party) and the Nation of Islam (NOI) as a hate groups. In their FAQ section they explain why they don’t list Antifa as a hate group and answer questions such as how they classify anti-immigrant hate groups, and anti-LGBT hate groups. \nIn 2018, SPLC President Richard Cohen posted an apology and paid a financial settlement to Maajid Nawaz and to the Quilliam Foundation for mischaracterizing them as anti-Muslim extremists. Further, SPLC apologized to Ben Carson and removed his designation in their Extremist Files.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center uses emotionally loaded headlines such as these: “President Trump is stoking white nationalism, exploiting racist fear” and “In wake of Trump’s ‘shithole’ comment, celebration among the far right.” Further, the SPLC sources their information with quotes, video/audio evidence, but often does not hyperlink to other sources. In general, the majority of articles published by SPLC favors the left and portrays the right negatively.\nThe SPLC is often criticized by hate groups and the far right as being extreme left biased. This is not accurate. The SPLC applies a methodology to their designations that is consistent no matter what side (left or right) the groups are on. SPLC explains on their FAQ page that there are simply more hate groups affiliated with the right, based on their definition of a hate group, which states “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” This definition is similar to the FBI’s definition of what constitutes a hate crime.\n A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\n\nOverall, we rate the Southern Poverty Law Center, Left Biased based on story selection that favors the Left and through strong political advocacy for social justice. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record and although they have mischaracterized some groups and individuals, they ultimately apologized, acknowledged their error and made appropriate corrections.

Glenn Greenwald is a former constitutional law and civil rights litigator who is also known for obtaining and publishing Edward Snowden’s leaks about NSA surveillance while working for The Guardian. \nThe Intercept’s long term mission is “to provide aggressive and independent adversarial journalism across a wide range of issues, from secrecy, criminal and civil justice abuses and civil liberties violations to media conduct, societal inequality and all forms of financial and political corruption.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Intercept is funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s media company, First Look Media, a non-profit media organization focused on entertainment studio, consumer businesses, and journalism. Omidyar initially committed $250 million and continues to support it through First Look Media.  First Look Media’s other brands include Topic, Field of Vision and the Nib. The Intercept also recieves reader donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Intercept has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats such as this New Yorker article that reads “Greenwald’s focus on “deep state” depredations has exiled him from MSNBC but has given him a place on Fox News.” Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald has criticized MSNBC host Rachel Maddow for turning into an “utterly scripted, intellectually dishonest, partisan hack.” Greenwald says these criticism have led to an end of his appearances on MSNBC. Greenwald often criticized left leaning media coverage of Trump-Russia collusion, namely CNN, MSNBC and CBS, arguing that “very little evidence supported the idea that Moscow was hot for Donald.” However, The Intercept is harshly critical of both Donald Trump and right wing policies with articles such as this: Trump’s Muslim Ban Is Culmination of War on Terror Mentality but Still Uniquely Shameful.\nIn review, The Intercept publishes articles with strongly emotionally loaded language such as “The Ignored Legacy of George H.W. Bush: War Crimes, Racism, and Obstruction of Justice” and “The 10 Most Appalling Articles in the Weekly Standard’s Short and Dreadful Life.” The Intercept rejects mainstream establishment politics in favor of progressive liberalism with this pro-Bernie Sanders quote: “ignore the opinion polls and the bogus arguments against him: whether you like him or not, Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner right now”, from “Critics Say Bernie Sanders Is Too Old, Too White, and Too Socialist to Run for President in 2020. They’re Wrong.” When it comes to sourcing The Intercept always uses credible sources such as Washington Examiner, The Economist, The Hill Politico, NYMag, and the Washington Post. \nIn general, The Intercept provides indepth investigative stories that are sensational in nature. Most stories are critical of the right-left establishment and lean strongly progressive left in ideology.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check, however in 2016 they fired Juan Thompson for fabricating quotes and establishing email accounts to trick editors. The Intercept reported: “Thompson admitted to creating fake email accounts and fabricating messages, but stood by his published work. He did not cooperate in the review,”\nOverall, we rate The Intercept progressive Left Biased based on story selection that favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing. (5/18/2016) Updated (M.

The Nation covers world and national news, politics, economy, arts, culture and more. The Nation considers itself as a continuation of William Lloyd Garrison’s anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator. \nThe Nation’s founding publisher was Joseph H. Richards, and the Irish born American Journalist Edwin Lawrence Godkin, who had formerly worked as a correspondent of the London Daily News and editor of the New York Evening Post.  After the Nation was sold to the New York Evening Post, Godkin became editor of the Post, a position he held until his retirement in 1899. Wendell Phillips Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison, was Literary Editor from 1865 to 1906. The Nation was bought by newspaperman-turned-railroad-baron Henry Villard in 1881 and The Nation became a weekly supplement for the New York Evening Post (Later it became the New York Post). After Henry Villard, his son, Oswald Garrison Villard, would became the new owner in 1900.\nThe Nation masthead states that it is edited and published by Katrina vanden Heuvel. Richard Kim is Executive Editor and the President is Erin O’Mara. According to their about page the magazine describes itself as “Principled. Progressive”.\nFunded by / Ownership\nKatrina vanden Heuve is the editor, publisher, and part-owner of The Nation. She also writes an op-ed column for the Washington Post. Subscription and advertising is The Nation’s main revenue as well as donations, which contributes to the Nation Builders campaign.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Nation endorsed Bernie Sanders for President in 2016. They also have been criticized for being a Pro-Russia publication by both conservatives and liberals. Here is a quote from the right leaning Washington Free Beacon: “The Nation’s modern day Russia coverage has been criticized as too pro-Putin. Stephen F. Cohen, who is the husband of editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, has been characterized as a Putin apologist.” However, an op-ed writer for the The Nation, was forcibly removed from a press briefing between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin on July 16, 2018 for holding up a sign regarding a nuclear weapons ban treaty, according to CNBC. \nIn review, The Nation reports news with emotionally loaded words and bias such as “Judge Kavanaugh: An Originalist With a New—and Terrifying—Interpretation of Executive Power” and “It’s Time to Disrupt NATO, But not for the reasons Trump gives.”\nTypically, The Nation utilizes credible sources such as the Associated Press and The Chronicle of Higher Education, however they also source through large quotes as well.\nA factual search reveals The Nation has failed one fact check and in general produces well written journalism that is factual and well sourced. \nOverall, we rate The Nation Left Biased due to story choices and wording that favor the left and factually high based on proper sourcing. (5/15/2016) Updated (M.

Straight news mostly comes from other sources such as the Associated Press, Propublica and the Independent Media Institute. News is broken down into categories such as LGBTQ, environment, immigration and activism to name a few. In general, straight news favors the left and editorially there is a strong left leaning bias through the issues they advocate. \nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Truthdig Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to excellent sourcing and a clean fact check record. (11/18/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/8/2019)",

There is significant use of loaded emotional language that favors the left such as this: Scapegoating Unions for the Postal Service’s Phony Crisis. This op-ed is properly sourced to credible outlets such as Brookings and whitehouse.gov. Straight news reporting comes from both Truthout staff, as well as republishing from other sources. Most of the sources used for republishing are left leaning such as Common Dreams, Salon and Rewire. In general, story selection always favors the left with negative reporting on President Trump such as this: Donald Trump’s Only Strategy Is to Create Crisis and Claim to Fix It.\nWhen it comes to science Truthout holds a negative view toward GMO’s and uses highly sensationalized and conspiratorial headlines such as this: Have Monsanto and the Biotech Industry Turned Natural Pesticides Into GMO “Super Toxins”?\nAlthough Truthout has not failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker, they have reported some stories that were not factual.  For example, a reporter claimed that Karl Rove was indicted on charges when in fact he wasn’t.  The reporter continued to make the claim without evidence.  See link here. Although this is only one example, it shows that this source should be checked when in doubt.\nOverall, we rate Truthout strongly Left Biased based on story selection and political positions that favor the left.

The ideological positions of Workers World consist primarily of workers’ struggles, anti-racism and discrimination. There is moderate to heavy use of loaded emotional words in both headlines and articles that favor the far left and socialist/communist viewpoints. All articles reviewed favored the left over the right. Workers World tends to source their information, however sometimes they used far left sources that have not always been factual in the past.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 2002 as a radio program, The Young Turks (TYT) is now an American political commentary web series that was created by journalist Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz and Dave Koller. Currently co-hosted by Uygur and Ana Kasparian, although its primary focus is on political commentary, the program provides opinion on topics of varying news genres.\nLaunched in 2006, TYT was the first daily streaming online talk show. In 2017, TYT won a Webby Award for best YouTube Presence and on May 17, 2018, The Young Turks launched a 24-hour linear channel on YouTube TV, which includes all of TYT’s current shows and four new shows called The Damage Report, “#NoFilter”,“The Happy Half Hour” and “Old-School Sports”.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe TYT website does not disclose who owns the Young Turks Network, however it is assumed to be primarily held by Cenk Uygur. In 2017, TYT received 20 million in funding “by newly formed growth equity fund 3L Capital, with additional backing from venture capital veterans Greycroft Partners and e.ventures, as well as Jeffrey Katzenberg’s recently launched WndrCo.” TYT is also supported by the Media Consortium, which is a nonprofit that supports independent journalism. The Media Consortium in turn “got funding from the Chicago Community Trust, the Park Foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, and the Media Democracy Fund. The Media Democracy Fund lists 12 funding partners and one of them is Soros’ the Open Society Foundations.\nThe website and YouTube channel generates revenue through paid subscriptions, advertising and sales of merchandise.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Young Turks produces progressive left video news programing as well as written articles on their website. Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this: Rep. Rashida Tlaib was sworn in using Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Quran and, of course, people were mad. and For Tucker Carlson Sponsors, Immigration is Complicated. TYT tends to source their information to credible media outlets such as the Washington Post, USA Today, Sec.gov and Open Secrets. Editorially, The Young Turks tend to support progressive candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In general, all news reporting favors the left and aggressively attacks the right.\nTYT generally supports the consensus of science on most issues, however when it comes to GMO they tend to promote propaganda that points to the dangers of GMO and Glyphosate.\nA factual search reveals that The Young Turks have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Young Turks Left Biased based on story selection that always favors the progressive left and Mixed for factual reporting due to promotion of pseudoscience in regards to GMO’s.

Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with their stance on the rights they champion. The ACLU has defended the KKK, Pro Abortion, and Neo-Nazi’s right to assemble and protest (1 2 3).  They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights, however they equally do not champion gun regulations either.  A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on.  They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs.  They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feed’s can often be filled with more left leaning stances, but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However, the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left, but with the major shift in American politics to the right, I can no longer advocate that stance.\nA factual search reveals a few failed fact checks.\n\n“When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today: ‘Yeah, we’re open.'” – Pants on Fire\nVoter identification laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID, essentially instituting a modern-day poll tax. – Mostly False\n“Half the states in the U.S. have laws that criminalize criticism.” – Mostly False\n\nOverall, we rate the ACLU Left-Center biased based on supporting left leaning positions. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to a few failed fact checks. (M. Allen 2/9/2017) Updated (3/4/2019)",

There is moderate use of loaded emotional language that favors the left such as this: Trump’s Space Force declaration a small step, not giant leap. In general, slightly more news stories favor the left, however editorials have a frequent left wing bias such as: Editorial: Jeff Sessions and a repugnant American development. Sourcing for information is typically from credible high factual media outlets.

While this reflects the individual author’s opinions more than any specific editorial stance this slight lack of focus in overall content is what prevented ATTN from receiving a Least Biased rating. Additionally, ATTN does cite itself occasionally in its other articles, which I find a bit self serving when any news site does it. Even if the content cited is factual. While again, this may reflect the individual author’s rather than editorial intent, it’s easy enough to use external sources instead.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1922  by John Reith, The British Broadcasting Company is Britain’s public broadcaster. The company later became the British Broadcasting Corporation. The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) began its daily radio transmissions in 1922. The BBC currently provides television, radio, online services throughout Britain and overseas and is headquartered in the Broadcasting House, London, United Kingdom. \nThe BBC began the world’s first regular television service in 1932. During the second world war, TV broadcasting was suspended and BBC radio was an important source for news and entertainment. The BBC held a monopoly on television in Great Britain until 1954 and on radio until 1972. \nFunded by / Ownership\nThe BBC operates under a Royal Charter, which is renewed every 10 years. The Royal Charter abolished the BBC Trust and the regulatory functions of the BBC Trust were transferred to The Office of Communications or Ofcom, in 2017. The operations of the BBC are governed by a board of directors, consisting of thirteen people. Currently, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England David Clementi is the Chairman of the BBC and Tony Hall is the Director-General of the BBC (Editor-in-Chief ). The BBC is financed by consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers (1947 Wireless and Telegraphy Act) which enables BBC’s UK services to be free of advertisements and independent of shareholder and political interests.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, both sides of the political spectrum have accused BBC of either having a liberal bias or conservative bias. For example, an Evening Standard article based on an interview with a former BBC employee, describes the BBC as a “Nest of Lefties promoting a progressive agenda and political correctness.” According to a Times of London article the BBC is biased against Israel, therefore it has a left bias. The BBC states in their editorial guidelines that they are impartial and free from both political and commercial influence. The BBC also has an Executive Complaints Unit in which the Daily Mail published an article regarding how the complaints unit works. The article states “There was also a sharp increase in accusations of political bias and religious prejudice.” The BBC then wrote a response to the Daily Mail article: “The Mail also said that the figures ‘showed the level of dissatisfaction over issues such as left-wing bias, offensive content and inaccuracy’. In fact there is a very wide range of reasons why people complain. For example we often get complaints of ‘bias’ about the same programme from two or more opposing sides of the many issues we cover, not just ‘left wing’”.\n\nAccording to New Statesman research, which was examining the impartiality of BBC’s reporting shows that in certain areas they lean right, such as business, immigration, and religion. Examples of right bias, includes the BBC being accused of doctoring the image of Jeremy Corbyn, who serves as Leader of the Labour Party (Corbyn identifies as a democratic socialist) wearing a Russian style cap in front of a Moscow skyline to make him look more Russian. BBC rejected the complaints by claiming the decision to publish Corbyn in a “Lenin-style cap in front of the Moscow skyline was not designed to convey an impression of pro-Russian sympathy on Corbyn’s part, but was in keeping with an editorial decision made on the basis of sound news judgment”.\nWhen reporting general news the BBC always sources its information and uses minimal loaded words in headlines such as this: Trump chief of staff John Kelly to leave White House job. When it comes to reporting on the USA and in particular President Donald Trump, there is a negative tone directed at Trump and his policies. In general, the BBC covers both sides of stories, with a slight bias in favor of the left.\nA factual search reveals that the BBC has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the BBC Left-Center biased based on story selection that slightly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information. (5/15/2016) Updated (M.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 2006 and headquartered in New York, Buzzfeed is a media news company delivering social news and entertainment. They provide a mix of breaking news, entertainment and shareable content. Jonah Peretti and John Johnson are the founders of Buzzfeed and the editor-in-chief is Ben Smith. In 2016, BuzzFeed split the News operation off from the BuzzFeed Entertainment Group, which aims to focus more on BuzzFeed’s video unit. The Buzzfeed brands are Tasty, Nifty, Goodful and more. \nFunded by / Ownership\nBuzzFeed is funded by numerous investors. NEA (New Enterprise Associates), New York-based venture capital firm RRE and Hearst Ventures were the early investors of Buzzfeed.  \nIn 2015, NBC (Comcast) invested $200 million in BuzzFeed and in 2016 they invested another $200 million. BuzzFeed also raised $50 million dollars from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. BuzzFeed is privately owned and does not disclose financial results to the public. However, BuzzFeed missed its revenue target in 2017 by 15%-20%. According to a New York Times article by Edmund Lee, founder Jonah Peretti says his company could eventually merge with rival online publishers in order to negotiate better terms with Facebook.\nThe BuzzFeed business model relies primarily on native advertising in the form of quizzes and videos sponsored by companies, which also goes by the name sponsored content or advertorial, which is advertising content that looks like an editorial.\nAnalysis / Bias\nBuzzFeed often publishes “Listicles” with images or GIFs and short content with links such as “100 Pictures That’ll Make You Pee Yourself Laughing”  or “42 Cat GIFs Guaranteed To Make You Laugh Every Time”.  They also publish viral videos, as well as political news on their news website.\n In review of their reporting of news stories, Buzzfeed utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines “Trump Excluded Democrats From A Lunch Meeting On The Shutdown” and “The US Envoy On ISIS, Brett McGurk, Quit In Protest Over Trump’s Withdrawal From Syria”.  When it comes to sourcing they typically source to themselves, however they also utilize credible sources such as the Des Moines Register and Associated Press. Further, BuzzFeed does not clearly label opinion pieces, which makes it difficulty to tell the difference between straight news content and editorials. In general, most Buzzfeed stories favor the left.\nIn January 2017, Buzzfeed published the Steele Dossier about alleged Russia collusion, which caused President Donald Trump to criticize them by saying Buzzfeed is a ‘failing pile of garbage’. In December 2018, according to Politico, “The libel case over the dossier it published before Trump took office gets tossed.”\nA factual search reveals that Buzzfeed has failed three fact checks that can be seen here and here and here.\nOverall, we rate Buzzfeed Left-Center Biased due to story selection that tends to favor the left and Mixed for factual reporting based on poor sourcing and a few failed fact checks. (6/30/2016) Updated (M.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1936 by an Act of Parliament, Canada’s public broadcaster, CBC is a division of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which replaced the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. CBC presents news, talk, music and entertainment programs in English, French and Aboriginal languages. The CBC is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nIn 2009, CBC’s Television News, Radio News and Digital News departments were merged into CBC News. Michael Goldbloom is the chairman and Catherine Tait is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe CBC Board previously consisted of 12 members, all appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada. For example, former conservative prime minister Stephen Harper was accused of appointing the board with members that were also conservative donors. In 2016, Brian Mitchell (who was appointed to the CBC board by then prime minister Stephen Harper in 2008) resigned to seek the presidency of the Conservative Party of Canada. However, recently this structure has changed, and now the non-partisan Independent Advisory Committee does “merit-based” appointments. According to a Globe and Mail article “A government source said the board would comprise nine ‘experts in broadcasting and digital technology, representatives of cultural sectors from across Canada,’ as well as ‘Indigenous peoples, official-language communities and youth,’ who will be charged with compiling a list of candidates whose names will be submitted to the government.”\nThe CBC’s main revenue comes from government funding (66%), other sources of revenue include advertising revenue (18%), subscriber fees (8%) and other sources. You can also view CBC Business Model details Here.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, when it comes to world news CBC re-publishes stories from credible sources such as the Associated Press and Reuters: “U.S. stock markets flirt with end of historic rise” and “Indonesian rescuers struggle against heavy rain to reach tsunami-hit villages.”\nCBC reports Canadian national news with neutral headlines such as: “The 5 most dramatic moments of the year in Ontario politics”. When it comes to sourcing, the CBC typically sources to other CBC articles. This is acceptable as CBC produces and reports its own national news. \nIn general, CBC’s straight news reporting is consistently low biased, factual and covers both sides of issues. Editorially, the opinion pages tend to be balanced with some stories slightly leaning left such as this: Doug Ford’s ‘efficiencies’ seem to be costing taxpayers an awful lot of money: Robyn Urback and right leaning: Why low-income earners should actually welcome Ontario’s reversal on rent control. Opinion pieces have also been critical of liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On a whole, slightly more opinion pieces favor the left. Further, the right leaning National Post has accused the CBC of liberal bias.\nA factual search reveals that the CBC has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate CBC Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that leans slightly left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. ( 7/27/2016) Updated (M.

         "notes":"History\nLaunched in 1989, as a cable business news network by NBC, CNBC “Consumer News and Business Channel” is a cable TV channel located in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. CNBC is owned by the NBC Universal News Group, which is in turn owned by Comcast Corp. In 1991, CNBC acquired the 10 year old cable news channel Financial News Network (FNN) (owned by Rodney Buchser, Dr. Glen H. Taylor and Merrill Lynch) for $105 million dollars and merged with CNBC. CNBC primarily focuses on reporting about business, finance and commerce. The Chairman of CNBC is Mark Hoffman and he reports to Stephen B. Burke (CEO of NBC Universal). Jay Yarow is Senior Vice President and Executive Editor for CNBC Digital, which is responsible for setting the editorial direction for all CNBC Digital products and services.\nSome of CNBC programs and hosts are “Squawk Box” hosted by Joe Kernen, Becky Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, as well as “Closing Bell”, anchored by Sara Eisen and Wilfred Frost, “Squawk Alley” hosted by Morgan Brennan, Carl Quintanilla, Jon Fortt, and “Mad Money” hosted by Jim Cramer.\nFunded by / Ownership\nCNBC is currently owned by NBC Universal, which is in turn owned by Comcast. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Comcast is Brian L. Roberts, which was founded by his father, Ralph J. Roberts. CNBC’s revenue is mainly derived from advertising and cable subscription fees. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, CNBC uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Billionaire megadonor Robert Mercer cuts back on support for GOP after being scrutinized for backing Trump” and “Trump resumes attack on the Fed as markets sink again.” CNBC typically utilizes credible sources such as campaignlegal.org, fec.gov (federal election commission), poll.qu.edu (Quinnipiac University), and Bloomberg News. While news reporting is typically balanced and related to financial news, there is frequent negative coverage of President Trump such as this: A potential Trump impeachment is a ‘huge risk’ for 2019, expert says. In general, story selection moderately favors the left, which has resulted in criticism of liberal bias by Right leaning Real Clear Politics.\nA factual search reveals that CNBC has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate CNBC Left-Center Biased based on story selection that leans left and High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing and a clean fact check record.

It was described as a newspaper for gentlewomen, however it was not successful, therefore it moved to a broader focus. Its new editor Hamilton Fyfe converted the paper into a photo rich format using photojournalism. The paper’s next owner was Alfred Harmsworth’s brother Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, who is also known to be an admirer of Mussolini and supporter of Nazi Germany. In 1935, Lord Rothermere sold his shares in the newspaper to H. G. Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp, with the paper becoming a left-wing working-class newspaper. In 1951, Cecil King replaced Bartholomew as chairman, however he was sacked in 1968, when he began using the newspaper to attack the head of the Labour Party, Harold Wilson. Currently Reach plc is the owner and Alison Phillips is the current Editor.\nFunded by / Ownership\nBritish Publishing Company Reach plc (formerly Trinity Mirror) owns The Daily Mirror. Revenue is generated through digital advertising, print ads and subscription fees.  \nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Daily Mirror uses pictures as the main feature of the story with the pages mainly covered by photographs. However, they are also known to use fake photographs, which caused its editor Piers Morgan to resign. The Guardian has also revealed that The Daily Mirror used a misleading stock photo that misrepresented the story.\n In review, The Mirror uses emotionally loaded sensational headlines and content that is oversimplified such as “School sends girl, 5, home in different outfit and asks her to ‘cover her body.” The source for this story is a Facebook post. Further, the paper has a section called “mums” that also presents sensational headlines such as this: “Woman goes on romantic holiday with boyfriend – and returns with lesbian love.” When it comes to world news pertaining to the USA, they publish articles with emotionally loaded anti-Trump toned headlines such as “Donald Trump WON’T be allowed to stay at Buckingham Palace during UK state visit.”  In general, articles are poorly sourced and written in a “gossip” style.  When it comes to British news, again The Mirror rarely use hyperlinks to source others, instead sourcing back to themselves. \nPolitically, The Mirror publishes anti-Brexit articles such as “The Brexit Zombies are going to eat this country alive.” While they do criticize the Labor Party, they did endorse them in the last election. Lastly, according to YouGov.com its political stance in the UK is known as left of center.\nA factual search reveals that The Mirror has failed a few fact checks.\n\nOverall, we rate The Daily Mirror Left-Center Biased based on story selection that moderately favors the Left and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing and a few failed fact checks.

The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college, was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver.\nIn 2013, ESPN became owner of FiveThirtyEight and in April 2018 the site was acquired by ABC News.\nFunded by / Ownership\nFiveThirtyEight is owned by ABC News, which in turn is owned by the Walt Disney Company. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, FiveThirtyEight is different from other polling sources in that they do not conduct the polls, but rather deeply analyze other polls and apply a strict methodology to determine accuracy. For example, Real Clear Politics simply takes the averages of all polls to come up with a score, whereas 538 uses weights on each individual poll based on demographics and much more. One can argue this is more accurate and 538’s early track record proved it was. However, in 2016 they gave President Trump a 29% chance of winning. This does not mean they were wrong, because they still had a 29% chance of being correct, but they clearly were not very close on this one with their methods.\n538 also reports news on their website that tends to lean left, however, they have been criticized as being opposed to the progressive left. News articles typically utilize moderate to minimal loaded language such as this: How Amy Klobuchar Could Win The 2020 Democratic Nomination. This article relies on proper sourcing from the likes of ABC News, Monmouth University and Senate.gov. A review of news stories reveals a more positive tone toward the left such as this: Trump Is Wrong. When The Opposition Party Runs The House, The President Gets Investigated.\nIn general, 538 tends to stick to poll related news, but when discussing politics, they usually slightly favor the left through story selection and wording.\nA factual search reveals that FiveThirtyEight has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate FiveThirtyEight (538) Left-Center Biased based on story selection that slightly favors the left, but does not favor the progressive left.

         "notes":"History\nThe Inquisitr was launched in 2008 by former TechCrunch writer Duncan Riley, as a blog that covers the topics of pop culture, entertainment/celebrity gossip, technology, sports, news, lifestyle, science, and politics. In 2011, Israeli Businessman Daniel Treisman purchased the website for $330,000.\nThe Inquisitr states its mission as “The Inquisitr aims to publish quality news articles and make them accessible to readers worldwide, while providing the best possible quality and experience to those seeking useful and timely news information.”\n\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Inquisitr was originally owned by Duncan Riley and is currently owned by Israeli businessman Daniel Treisman. Inquisitr is a news aggregation site that employs online, freelance writers who are considered sub-contractors. The Inquisitr’s primary source of revenue is digital advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Inquisitr publishes celebrity gossip such as “Cardi B, Nicki Minaj Put An End To Their Bitter Feud.” The Inquisitr also tends to republish stories by rehashing articles published by different sources such as this Hill article: “Republicans Beginning To Believe Donald Trump ‘Unfit’ To Be President, Says Watergate Reporter”. When it comes to sourcing, they typically mention the original source and provide hyperlinks to outside sources, as well as frequently sourcing to themselves. The Inquisitr has also referenced sources that have a poor track record with fact checkers, such as the right leaning conspiracy/pseudoscience website Natural News. They have also been criticized for inaccuracy in reporting by Slate and Psychology Today. In general, the majority of stories lean left in story selection and wording, though there is an occasional article that is slightly negative toward the left.\nA factual search reveals a few failed fact checks:\n\nDid Costco remove a dinosaur cake from their online ordering system because a customer complained that it bore a hidden “demonic” symbol? – FALSE\nFlorida Man Turns Himself in for Murdering Imaginary Friend? – FALSE\nDoctors Kill More People Than Guns? – FALSE\n\nOverall we rate Inquisitr, Left-Center biased due to story selection that moderately favors the left and factually Mixed due to the use of questionable sources and a few failed fact checks. (10/16/2016) Updated (M.

The LA Times was acquired by then Editor/publisher Harrison Gray Otis. In 1885, Harry Chandler, who had been hired initially as a circulation department clerk, become Harrison Otis’ son in law. Under Chandler and Otis the paper was anti-union, which led to the 1910 bombing of the LA Times building, resulting in the deaths of 21 employees. In 1944, Norman Chandler succeeded his father Harry Chandler and in the 1960’s, Norman’s son Otis Chandler became the owner and publisher of the LA Times. Otis Chandler “transformed the Los Angeles Times from a conservative paper into a Pulitzer Prize-winner.” It was under Otis Chandler that the paper won its first of 44 Pulitzer Prizes. \nIn June 2000, Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune, acquired Times Mirror Co., parent company of the LA Times, which ended “100 years of local ownership of The Times by the Otis and Chandler families.” \nIn 2018, Biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired LA Times for $500m from the Tribune Publishing Company (formerly Tronc) and became the owner and executive chairman of the Los Angeles Times. Former Vice Chairman of Time inc., Norman Pearlstine is the Executive Editor. See the Masthead for a complete list of the editorial team. \nThe LA Times covers local/national news, business, entertainment, political analysis and sports news. The LA Times is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. \nFunded by / Ownership\nBiotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is the owner of LA Times. The paper is funded through advertising, subscriptions and newsstand sales.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the LA Times (Los Angeles Times) uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly defends his rocky tenure” and “Engaging with the world doesn’t make Americans ‘suckers’”  The wording within articles also tends to lean left as evidenced by this quote from an editorial “Congress needs to focus not only on how amateurishly Trump executes foreign policy but the clear shortcomings of the policy itself.” When it comes to sourcing the LA Times rarely uses hyperlinked sourcing, which is acceptable as news stories are covered and written by their journalists. When using hyperlinked sources they utilize credible ones such as the Financial Times.\nEditorially, the LA Times has endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates in the last three elections and during 2016 General Election the LA Times stated that “Hillary Clinton would make a sober, smart and pragmatic president. Donald Trump would be a catastrophe.”  \nIn a 2018 Interview, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong told NPR “We’ll be as competitive vis-à-vis the The New York Times and The Washington Post.”\nA factual search reveals that the LA Times has never failed a fact check.\n\nOverall, we rate the LA Times, Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that favor the left and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record. (5/18/2016) Updated (M.

Mother Jones focuses on investigative journalism on topics including politics, governments, corporations, environment, crime & justice. They distribute their content via digital and social platforms, videos, podcasts, email newsletters and print magazine. They describe their mission as “to deliver hard-hitting reporting that inspires change and combats “alternative facts.” In 1993, they became the first general interest magazine to go online.\nCurrently, Steve Katz is the publisher. Mother Jones is published by The Foundation for National Progress. Monika Bauerlein is CEO and Clara Jeffery is the Editor-in-Chief. David Corn is the Washington bureau chief and an on-air analyst for MSNBC.\nFor the complete list of staff, click here.  \nFunded by / Ownership\nMother Jones’ Non Profit Parent company and publisher is the Foundation for National Progress (FNP) and according to the MacArthur Foundation, the Foundation for National Progress received $1.5 million grants in support for its in-depth investigative journalism work. The Board of Directors can be seen here and the complete donor list here. \nMother Jones’ primary source of revenue is reader donations, subscriptions, advertising and foundation grants, for example the Craigslist founder gave $1 million to Mother Jones in 2018.  You can find details of their finances and IRS Form 990s Here. \nAnalysis / Bias\nAlthough Mother Jones political inclinations have been described as progressive, they did not endorse any political party during the 2016 presidential election. They have published articles with an anti-Bernie Sanders tone such as from this article “Poor Bernie Sanders has fallen victim to the hack gap.” This stance has been criticized by other left leaning publications as “Mother Jones’ Legacy Is Haunting Mother Jones as the Magazine Embraces Neoliberalism”. However, they have also been critical of Hillary Clinton with this article: Let’s Cut the Crap About Why Hillary Clinton Lost.\nMother Jones frequently publishes detailed investigative journalism such as “The full data set from our in-depth investigation into mass shootings.” This investigation has been criticized by some on the right, such as Reason.com.\nIn review, some articles we analysed offers support for Republicans such as “This Deep-Red State Decided to Make a Serious Investment in Preschools. It’s Paying Off Big-Time”, by praising Lawmakers such as Jeana Ross, Republican Secretary for the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, and Alabama state Senator Trip Pittman for their accomplishments in the states preschool program. On the other hand, they also have other articles we reviewed that has emotionally loaded headlines that are negative toward Republicans such as “Patriots Games, Birthday Bashes, and Vicious Tweets: Trump and Romney’s Failed Bromance.” \nIn general, story selection moderately favors the left, although the progressive left tends to be criticized more often than the establishment left. When it comes to sourcing, Mother Jones sources to credible media outlets such as Reuters, NY Times, The Hill, CNN, Time Magazine, NPR, Politico, Washington Examiner, and C-Span.\nA factual search reveals that Mother Jones has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Mother Jones strongly Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing.  (5/13/2016) Updated (M.

MSN aggregates news from a wide variety of mainstream sources. The MSN News homepage breaks news into categories such as World, US, Business, Politics, Local, etc. \nFunded by / Ownership\nMSN News is owned by Microsoft.\nAnalysis / Bias\nDetermining the a bias of a news aggregator is different than from a single source that produces original content. The wording on MSN News comes from other sources, so we will not even look at that as a factor. The most logical way to determine the bias of a news aggregator is too look at the sources they use for their news content. To accomplish this we looked at what sources were being used in the categories US News and World News. Over the course of three days we looked at the top 25 sources in each category for a total of 150 sources calculated. We then compared these sources to our bias ratings and calculated what percentage come from each bias category. Overall, the majority of stories on MSN News come from Left-Center sources (51%) and 31% from Least Biased sources. Further, Right-Center sources only made up 1% of the news and Right biased 5%, while on the other hand 12% of stories come from the Left Biased category. When looking at purely left-leaning vs right-leaning sources, the numbers favor the left. See charts below:\n\n\nIt should be noted that we are not stating MSN is willfully biased, we are pointing out that the sources used have a preference for the left according to our ratings. This could be due to how the algorithm works and also that there simply are more mainstream news media that leans left.\nOverall, we rate MSN News strongly Left-Center biased with the majority of stories coming from Left-Center sources. We also rate them High for factual reporting because the majority of sources used are credible media outlets. (6/2/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 11/29/2018)",

NPR is based in Washington, D.C. \nNPR was established after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. The act created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and National Public Radio (NPR).\nThe first program broadcast on NPR was live coverage of the U.S. Senate deliberations on the Vietnam War in April 1971. NPR has also won numerous awards since its launch. Currently, Jarl Mohn is the CEO of NPR and the Ombudsman/Public Editor is Elizabeth Jensen. A list of NPR’s Board of Directors can be found Here. \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to a Columbia Journalism Review article dated 2010, a large portion of NPR’s revenue comes from dues and fees paid by Member stations and by corporate sponsorships. In another article by Columbia Journalism Review they state that as of 2017, NPR receives less than 1 percent of its total funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB). Other sources of revenue include institutional grants, individual contributions and fees paid by users of the Public Radio Satellite System. You can view all of NPR’s Financial Statements Here.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2000, the conservative pro-Israel media watchdog group CAMERA, accused NPR of being biased against Israel. In 2001, FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), a progressive media watchdog group criticized NPR for favoring Israel. FAIR also states “NPR is definitely skewing right.” Tim Groseclose, a professor in the Economics and Political Science Department at UCLA, and Jeff Milyo, an economics professor at the University of Missouri, reports NPR has liberal bias. Further, according to a Pew Research survey, 67% of NPR listeners identify as left of center, with 41% claiming to be consistently liberal. Finally, According to the Washington Post, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn has contributed to Democratic candidates in statewide races, including the campaign of Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton’s secretary of labor. \nIn review, NPR (National Public Radio) uses moderately emotional loaded headlines such as this: “President Trump’s Description of What’s ‘Fake’ Is Expanding.” Generally, story selection favors the Left with stories such as these: “Rise Of LGBTQ Candidates Could Usher In A ‘Rainbow Wave’ In 2018” and Majority Of Americans Don’t Want Roe v. Wade Overturned. They also report right leaning opinion pieces such as this: A Free-Market Economy Keeps Capitalism Ticking.\nNPR reports world news with neutral headlines such as “In Bangladeshi Camps, Rohingya Refugees Try To Move Forward With Their Lives. NPR typically sources their information to credible sources such as the Washington Post, maristpoll.marist.edu, ohchr.org, The Economist, UNICEF, New York Times and many more. NPR’s news reporting is consistently low biased, factual and covers both sides of issues. However, taken on a whole, NPR is favored by a liberal audience, which indicates programming and story selection tends to lean left to appeal to their core listeners.\nA factual search reveals that NPR has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate NPR (National Public Radio) Left-Center Biased based on story selection that leans slightly left and Very High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing and very accurate news reporting. (5/18/2016) Updated (M.

Editorially, they have historically been known to be conservative leaning, however in recent years they have endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates such as John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. On 6/18/2019, The Sentinel published an editorial declaring they would not endorse President Donald Trump in 2020: Our Orlando Sentinel endorsement for president in 2020: Not Donald Trump. A thorough review of the editorial page indicates a left leaning bias in story selection.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the Orlando Sentinel Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that slightly favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 7/29/2016) Updated (6/18/2019)",

Quartz publishes stories with neutral headlines such as “To understand Trump’s speech, look at the US-Mexico border as it exists today”, as well as strong emotionally loaded language such as “A living glossary of all the words you need to understand the Trump presidency.”  A quote from the article reads “Trump is seen as the editor-in-chief of the fake news movement because of his disregard of facts, such as when he claimed in a recent tweet, with no supporting evidence, that millions voted illegally in the US election.” When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize credible sources such as c-span.org, New York Times, Huffington Post, and USA Today.\nEditorially, Quartz does not endorse any political party, however their sister publication, The Atlantic endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential elections. Further, Quartz does not have a favorable view of President Trump with consistent negative articles pertaining to his administration: Another scandal-ridden member of Trump’s cabinet is resigning. Lastly, Quartz is generally pro-science with its reporting on GMO’s and Climate Change.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Quartz Left-Center Biased based on story selection that slightly favors left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (10/6/2016) Updated (M.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1903 by Australian Chinese revolutionary Tse Tsan-tai and British journalist Alfred Cunningham, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) is a Hong Kong based English-language newspaper. SCMP provides news, business, arts, tech and culture for global readers, with a focus on China and Asia. According to its about page, the South China Morning Post’s mission is to “Lead the global conversation about China.” SCMP is also Hong Kong’s newspaper of record and publishes fashion magazines, including Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Esquire and The Peak. \nOn April 5, 2016, Alibaba Group acquired SCMP Group in a $266 million deal including the South China Morning Post. Former CEO of Digg, Gary Liu is CEO of the South China Morning Post since 2017. Tammy Tam Wai Yee is the Editor-in-Chief. For a complete list of corporate executives please see here. \nFunded by / Ownership\n\nThe South China Morning Post is owned by Alibaba Group and published by South China Morning Post Publishers Limited. It is funded through advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\n\nAccording to a Quartz article dated 2017, they state that after being acquired by Alibaba Group, SCMP’s narrative became more pro-China. The article also quotes Joseph Tsai, Alibaba’s co-founder and vice chairman, as saying “We wanted to tell the biggest story of our lifetime, which is China.” According to the NY Times, the new mission of SCMP is “improving China’s image overseas and combating what it sees as anti-Chinese bias in the foreign media.” Reuters points out that Jack Ma, the head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is a Communist Party member.\nIn review, The South China Morning Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Chinese companies moving to Vietnam keep quiet on trade war to avoid wrath of authorities and staff.” This article does not report favorably on China as evidenced by this quote from the article “Chinese state media may have launched a fierce propaganda campaign, placing the blame for the trade war squarely at the feet of the US government.” They further state “Companies are also fearful of growing hostility from local governments in China, should they announce their plans to relocate.” In another example of negative reporting on China, we examined their critical tone regarding China’s vaccine scandal, with this quote “Disease numbers are being swept under the carpet and false expiry dates slapped on injections, industry insiders say.” In general, articles are poorly sourced and lack hyperlinks.\nWhen reporting U.S. news, they use minimally loaded language in their headlines such as “Donald Trump warns China to reach a trade deal now, or face a ‘far worse’ one if I get re-elected.” Again, when it comes to sourcing, they use quotes or source to themselves, rather than providing hyperlinks. They also write pro-China articles such as “Chinese President Xi Jinping warns of disaster if one civilisation imposes its will on another.”  Editorials tend be be pro- business such as this “Beijing could not give in to all US demands at recent talks out of concern for national dignity and matters of principle, so G20 may be last chance for the two leaders to meet ahead of an even more ferocious trade war.”\nAlthough SCMP has been accused of promoting China, we find evidence that they cover both sides by being critical of China as well as praising them.\nA factual search reveals that they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The South China Morning Post Left-Center biased based on editorial positions that moderately favor the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing.

Its original name is The Manchester Guardian and it was founded by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor. Taylor’s nephew Charles Prestwich Scott (CP Scott) was the first editor and later became the owner of the paper (1846 –1932). He was also a Liberal Member of Parliament. After CP Scott, his son John Russell Scott became the Manchester Guardian’s manager and founder of the Scott Trust. The Manchester Guardian was renamed the Guardian in 1959. In 1993 the Guardian Media Group acquired the Observer.\n\nThe Guardian US was launched in 2011, in New York. The Guardian also has an Australia Edition (Launched 2013, digital edition) and an International edition. Each edition can be viewed above the logo under the tab “edition”. The Guardian focuses on politics, policy, business and international relations. Their coverage includes: News and Opinion, Sports, Culture, Lifestyle, Podcasts and more.\nKatharine Viner is the editor-in-chief of the Guardian since 2015.  Evelyn Webster is CEO of Guardian US. John Mulholland is the editor of the Guardian US. You can view  the Guardian U.S editorial team here.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Guardian and its sister publication, Sunday newspaper The Observer, are both owned by Guardian Media Group plc (GMG). Scott Trust Limited was created in 1936, to ensure the editorial independence of the publications and owns Guardian Media Group plc (GMG). The Guardian states that “The Scott Trust is the sole shareholder in Guardian Media Group and its profits are reinvested in journalism and do not benefit a proprietor or shareholders.” The Guardian is funded through donations and an advertising model.\nThe Guardian switched to a tabloid print format in 2018 in order to cut costs. According to The New York Times, The Guardian “refused to set up a paywall — the preferred strategy of many of its rivals, from The Times of London to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times — opting instead to ask its readers for donations, even setting up a nonprofit arm to help fund its journalism.” \nAnalysis / Bias\nThroughout its history, The Guardian has always been a left-wing publication as they have stated in various articles.\n\nIn review, story selection favors the left, but is generally factual. They utilize emotionally loaded headlines such as “The cashless society is a con – and big finance is behind it” and “Trump back-pedals on Russian meddling remarks after outcry”.  The Guardian typically utilizes credible sources such as thoughtco.com, gov.UK, HuffPost, independent.co.uk, and the Miami Herald.\nA factual search reveals that the Guardian has a clean fact check record.\nOverall, we rate The Guardian Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

The Independent was launched by former Telegraph staffers Andreas Whittam Smith, Matthew Symonds, and Stephen Glover.  It is headquartered in London. In 1990, The Independent on Sunday was launched and edited by Stephen Glover. In 1994, the founders left the paper and Ian Hargreaves became the editor of the paper. A year later Newspaper Publishing was restructured, with Mirror Group and Tony O’Reilly’s Independent News & Media (INM) becoming joint owners of Newspaper Publishing. In 1998, INM took full control of the The Independent. O’Reilly bought out the company for £30m and in 2010 and then Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev acquired The Independent. In 2016, the paper moved to a digital-only format. Simon Kelner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Independent titles. Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder of The Independent, has also joined the board of Independent Print Limited. In 2017, Saudi Businessman Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper. \n\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Independent is owned by Independent Print Limited, a company owned by the Lebedev family (Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev). In 2017, Saudi Businessman Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper. The paper is funded through advertising and subscriptions. \n\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Independent recently joined up with a media group that has close links to the Saudi royal family to launch websites across the Middle East. Its partnering with a publisher that has strong links to the Saudi government has been criticized by the Guardian.\nIn review, The Independent tends to publish stories utilizing minimally loaded language in their headlines such as: “Theresa May insists Brexit deal is not dead despite EU leaders refusing to make further concessions”  and US news “Mueller investigation: Special counsel attacks Flynn criticism of FBI interview”. The Independent also republishes news from other credible sources such as the Associated Press: “Five things you didn’t know about Germany’s diesel ban”. In general, most stories favor the left and tend to be sourced properly utilizing credible sources such as USA Today and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.\nAccording to a 2017 survey conducted by You Gov UK, The Independent is viewed as having a center-left bias in reporting with 79% saying it was either Center or Left and only 21% saying it leaned right.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall we rate the The Independent Left-Center Biased due to story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (5/18/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 12/15/2018)",

In 1998, the partners sold part of Vice to Montreal software magnate Richard Szalwinski, however soon they bought the magazine back. Once called “Voice of Montreal” they eventually changed the name to Vice. In 1999, Vice relocated its base to New York City and became Vice Media, which grew into a digital media company that publishes online and in print magazines and expanded into millennial-driven media consisting of a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint and more.  Its news division, Vice News launched in 2013 and focused around news and current events. Currently, Nancy Dubuc is the CEO and Shane Smith is the Executive Chairman. According to its about page, Suroosh Alvi & Shane Smith are listed as owners, whereas Gavin McInnes is not listed since he left due to “creative differences”.  Gavin McInnes, later founded the Proud Boys which is defined as hate group. \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to Forbes, Shane Smith owns approximately (20%) and the rest of the shares belongs to The Walt Disney Company, A&E Networks, TPG Capital (the private equity group), and 21st Century Fox. Vice Media missed revenue targets by $100m and according to a Forbes article“ Disney wrote down $157m of its investment in Vice” which indicates a sign of trouble “for the youth-focused media company.” Further, CNBC reports Vice is reportedly reducing staff by 15%. Vice News is funded primarily through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2017, investigative reporting by Emily Steel of the New York Times, uncovered mistreatment and sexual harassment of women and workplace culture at Vice Media, which was described by ex-employees as toxic. Following the report, Vice Media President Andrew Creighton resigned, which then CEO and now Executive Chairman Shane Smith has acknowledged and apologized, promising change. The company later announced that they established a Diversity and Inclusion Board.\nIn review, Vice News offers a progressive liberal perspective in reporting such as “Millennials Don’t Love Capitalism but Can’t Stop Using Amazon”.  Vice News has an anti-Trump tone in their articles such as This Is What It Takes for a Trump Voter to Change Their Mind and “Trump Foundation is shutting down after the New York AG called it “little more than a checkbook” for Trump.” However, Vice News utilizes credible sources such as the Washington Post, ocf.berkeley.edu, Vox , AP, ag.ny.gov, Forbes, Washington Examiner, Business Insider , census.gov, and the NY Times. In general, more stories favor the left and present a more favorable left leaning perspective on issues.\nA factual search reveals that Vice News has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Vice Media Left-Center Biased due to wording and story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing.

Republican financier Eugene Meyer bought The Washington Post in 1946. After Meyer stepped down to become head of the Federal Reserve, his son-in-law, Philip Graham, became publisher. In 1947, after Philip Graham committed suicide, his wife, Katharine Meyer Graham took over the Washington Post Company. She was the first female publisher of a major American newspaper. Her son, Donald Graham, became publisher in 1979. Donald Graham, was the chairman of The Post before selling it to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Katharine Weymouth, a granddaughter of Katharine Meyer Graham and niece of Donald Graham served as the publisher of The Washington Post until her resignation in 2014. Currently, Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the founder of Politico and a former Reagan administration official is the Publisher and CEO of The Post. Martin Baron is the executive editor.\nFunded by / Ownership\nIn 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. Bezos is a frequent target of Trump, who has accused the businessman of using the Postal System as its “Delivery Boy.” The newspaper’s executive editor, Martin Baron said Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, is not involved in its news coverage. According to a NY Magazine article “Bezos is libertarian who has given money to anti-tax initiatives in the past” and supports gay marriage through donations. Bezos also donated to both Democratic and Republican Senators respectively.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe Washington Post played a part with The New York Times in publishing excerpts of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. The original papers can be viewed Here. The WaPo started reporting on Watergate in 1972, linking the DNC break-in to Nixon’s campaign and eventually brought down the administration of President Richard Nixon. \nAccording to Pew Research, the Washington Post is more trusted by a liberal readers than conservatives. However, in 2016, The Washington Post published an anti-Bernie Sanders editorial “Bernie Sanders’s fiction-filled campaign” that the New Republic called an “embarrassment.”\nThe WaPo was involved in a scandal in 1980, when they published an article by Janet Cooke that won the Pulitzer Prize. Cooke later returned the Pulitzer Prize when it turned out the story was not true.\nIn review, The Washington Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Trump escalates China trade war, announces plan for tariffs on $200 billion in products” and in editorials “The Trump administration created this awful border policy. It doesn’t need Congress to fix it.” When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize credible sources such as Propublica.org, Associated Press, Slate, Princeton.edu, New York Times, wired.com and CNN. Story selection and editorials tend to favor the left with the Washington Post only endorsing Democratic Presidential candidates since 1976, including Hillary Clinton in the last election. The Washington Post has also been accused of having an anti-Progressive bias, with numerous op-eds negative toward Bernie Sanders.\nOverall, we rate The Washington Post Left-Center biased due to story selection that favors the left and factually High due to the use of proper sources. (5/18/2016) Updated (M.

The company is registered at the home address of one of the board members at Klapparhlid in Mosfellsbaer.” According to their about page “WikiLeaks is entirely funded by its publisher, its publication sales and the general public.” They also generate revenue through an online shop that sells branded merchandise.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, WikiLeaks is a publisher of classified documents that it mostly gathers through leaks or hacking. The website currently boasts “10 million documents and associated analyses.” As of this date we cannot find verifiable evidence that these documents have been altered or faked in any way. In fact, WikiLeaks has faced criticism for not redacting enough information and not being selective in what they publish. This lack of redaction has resulted in names, social security and credit card numbers of private citizens to be compromised. Glenn Greenwald explains: “I used to defend WikiLeaks all the time on the grounds that they were not indiscriminate dumpers of information. They were carefully protecting people’s reputations. And they have changed their view on that—and no longer believe, as Julian says, in redacting any information of any kind for any reason—and I definitely do not agree with that approach and think that they can be harmful to innocent people or other individuals in ways that I don’t think is acceptable.”\nThroughout its history, WikiLeaks has released material that tends to reject militarism, authoritarianism and corporate control of political systems. This has resulted in more numerous exposures of right leaning authoritarian governments such as Turkey and Russia. Although, they have exposed left leaning candidates and parties, it was been through the lens of military and corporate corruption. Further, WikiLeaks has recently been leaking information that is damaging to the Trump administration due to their treatment of immigrants with the dumping of documents related ICE agents.\nAlthough WikiLeaks claims to release any information that they have, they often seem to release info that is more favorable to the Libertarian Left perspective. This is evidenced by publishing more information that is opposed to authoritarian right regimes. Further, even though WikiLeaks may favor the left they had a very clear bias against Hillary Clinton, with Assange writing an op-ed “A vote today for Hillary Clinton is a vote for endless, stupid war.” This further illustrates their anti-war narrative. Lastly, Assange admitted that his timing of release was to maximize damage against Clinton.\nThe Clinton DNC and Podesta e-mail releases have been linked to Russia and according to the Mueller report “It is clear that the stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from the GRU (The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation) to WikiLeaks.” Mueller claimed to have identified with specificity the “two military units of the GRU, which carried out the computer intrusions into the Clinton campaign, DNC, and DCCC: Military Units 26165 and 74455.” WikiLeaks and Julian Assange have denied this claim, going as far as promoting the conspiracy theory that Seth Rich was the whistleblower on the DNC email leak. Soon after this statement, the WikiLeaks official Twitter account offered a $20K reward leading to the arrest of the murderer. On 7/9/2019 it was reported that the Seth Rich Conspiracy theory that was promoted by WikiLeaks was falsely spread by Russian Intelligence.\nFurther, Mueller found evidence that the release of the emails were also tied to Roger Stone, longtime Trump adviser, who had contact with WikiLeaks. Finally, in April 2017, former Trump CIA Director Mike Pompeo stated: “It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.” Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia’s “primary propaganda outlet,” RT had “actively collaborated” with WikiLeaks. Ironically, Wikileaks publishes information against an authoritarian regime such as Russia, yet actively publishes their hacked information and even appears on Russian State TV.\nIn general, WikiLeaks publishes valid unaltered classified and leaked information. This information is factual and evidence based. As far as rating the bias of WikiLeaks, it is very difficult to put them on the Right-Left spectrum as it seems most of their leaks are opportunistic, rather than politically motivated. However, the editorial positions of WikiLeaks more closely aligns with the progressive left and limited government Libertarians.\nOverall, we rate WikiLeaks a borderline Conspiracy website with a Left-Center Bias based on a combination of progressive views, coupled with limited Government Libertarian positions. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the promotion of the Seth Rich-DNC Conspiracy Theory, as well as connections to the Russian Government and frequent use of anonymous sources.

         "notes":"History\nWired Magazine, based in San Francisco, California was launched in 1993 by avid libertarian Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, his partner in business and life. Wired covers the tech industry such as internet and digital culture, science and security. In 1998, Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe sold Wired Magazine to Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications Inc. for about $80 million. Former editor of the New Yorker, Nicholas Thompson was named editor in chief of Wired in 2017. Thompson is also a contributor for CBS News and regularly appears on CBS This Morning and CBSN. He is a co-founder of The Atavist.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\nAdvance Publication subsidiary Condé Nast Inc. is the current owner of Wired Magazine. Wired’s business model is primarily built on advertising. However, since January 2018, Wired, like other Condé Nast publications, is subscription based, which allows subscribers unlimited access without display advertising.  All readers have access to the homepage, section front pages, and four articles per month at no charge before being asked to subscribe. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Wired publishes magazine stories, news analysis, and web stories with a focus on technology. In doing so, they utilize emotive language both in their headlines and body of articles such as “Here’s how facebook actually won Trump the presidency.” Wired also reports on political issues that are related to the tech industry. For example, editor in chief Nicholas Thompson mentions in an interview, Wired’s position on Net Neutrality and why they report on it. We examined one of those articles “Kavanaugh On The Supreme Court Could Spell Trouble For Tech”, which favors a left leaning viewpoint on the subject. \nWhen it comes to sourcing, Wired typically utilizes credible sources such as cadc.uscourts.gov, Associated Press, Military.com, New York Times, Bloomberg, and US News and World Report. Wired also publishes pro-science articles such as “The Complexity of Simply Searching For Medical Advice” and utilizes pro-science sources such as PubMed and the CDC. \nA factual search reveals that Wired has never failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker.\nOverall, we rate Wired Left-Center biased in wording and report choices and factually high due to proper sourcing.

He Ping is the Editor-in-Chief and and Cai Mingzhao is the president. Cai Mingzhao is also a member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.  Xinhua News Agency‘s headquarter is located in Beijing. Xinhua News Agency focuses on providing daily coverage of business, politics, economics, sport, sci-tech and culture etc.\nReporters without Borders has reported China as the “World’s leading prison for citizen journalists.” According to their 2017 report, China ranks 176 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.\nFunded by / Ownership\nXinhua is owned by the People’s Republic of China and is funded by the sale of its news content that is similar to Reuters.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe content of headlines and articles use minimal loaded words pertaining to national news such as “Xi stresses real combat training” or “Xi says senior officials “crucial” in Party, state governance.” Their US coverage also utilizes minimally loaded headlines and least biased coverage “Analysis: U.S.-DPRK relations to be Trump’s biggest 2018 foreign policy challenge, experts say.” Although they completely lack linked sourcing they do provide credible sources such as Brookings Institute, Stratfor and Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, through the use of quotes.\nAccording to a Newsweek article “IS CHINA’S XINHUA THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM?”  Xinhua News Agency, by opening more overseas bureaus and expanding its business is similar to what “China’s state-run factories have done for tawdry baubles and cheap clothes: take something that has become a commodity and foist it onto the world far more cheaply than anyone else can. “It gives them an inherent competitive advantage.”\nFurther, according to CNBC in 2017, Xinhua News Agency mocked Indians by releasing a satirical video named the “Seven Sins of India.” The Chinese government has also banned certain words that the media can use in reporting.\nEditorially, there is a strong left wing bias with the endorsement of economic socialism and pro-Government propaganda. Furthermore, Xinhua cannot seem to glorify Xi Jinping enough.\nA factual search reveals the Xinhua has not failed a fact check by and IFCN fact checker.\nOverall, we rate Xinhua Left-Center biased based on left leaning editorials that endorse socialism/communism. When it comes to factual reporting we rate them Mixed due to a lack of linked sourcing and promotion of pro-Chinese government propaganda. (M. Huitsing 1/6/2018) Updated (D. Van Zandt 10/14/2018)",

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1996, Yahoo! News is a news website that originated as an internet-based news aggregator by the search engine Yahoo!. Articles originally came from popular news services such as the Associated Press, Reuters, Fox News and the BBC. \nIn 2011, Yahoo expanded its focus to include original content and in 2012 the website had a correspondent in the White House press corps for the first time. As of January 2019, Yahoo! News ranked sixth among global news sites, ahead of Fox News and behind CNN, according to Alexa.\nFunded by / Ownership\nYahoo! News is owned by Oath Inc, which is a digital media umbrella company for Verizon Communications. Yahoo generates revenue through advertising as well as an e-commerce shop.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Yahoo News! is primarily a news aggregator, however they do provide original content written by staff journalists. First, we will examine the sources used for aggregation. Yahoo News! breaks news down to the following categories: US, World, Politics, Originals and Health. Under US news, Yahoo News! aggregates content exclusively from Reuters. Under World News they use a combination of Reuters, Associated Press, Christian Science Monitor and AFP. The Politics section consists of only original content written by Yahoo Staff, as does the Originals section. Under the Health tab there is a wide variety of sources used, with none of them being High Science. Most stories are derived from magazines such as Self, Shape and Men’s Health. Finally, under the News Home tab they list all the stories from all the categories. On 4/4/2019, we reviewed the first 100 stories on the homepage and calculated percentages based on the bias of sources used. The results indicate that Yahoo News! selects more left leaning sources. See charts below.\n\n\nYahoo’s original content found on the Politics page, leans left in wording and story selection, such as this: Trump just a blowhard on windmills, lawmakers say of ‘idiotic’ comments. However, they will also publish information that is not favorable to Democrats, such as this: Seven women have now accused Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. On a whole, after reviewing dozens of original political news stories, more favor the left than the right. Further, original content is properly sourced to credible media outlets.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Yahoo News! Left-Center biased based on aggregation from more left leaning sources as well as editorial content that slightly favors the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting (original content) due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (5/18/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 4/5/2019)",

The alliance is chaired and run primarily by former senior United States intelligence officials. The initiative is funded by The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF), in the United States and Europe. In reviewing the blog portion of this website I found well sourced information that stuck to the topic of Russia’s misinformation campaigns in elections. All information was well sourced to mostly mainstream credible news sources that ranged from Left-Center to Right-Center in bias. The Alliance for Securing Democracy has also developed a tool called Hamilton 68 that tracks Russian propaganda on Twitter. We cannot verify the accuracy of this tool, but the information is interesting and delivered without comment. The Alliance for Securing Democracy has also been criticized by The Intercept for presenting a right leaning hawkish view point. Overall, we rate the Alliance for Securing Democracy as slightly right leaning least biased and factual in reporting. (D. Van Zandt 8/6/2017)",

The website is funded through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, American Military News’ reporting on national security and US military utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines and articles such as AZ man gets 12 years for helping college student join ISIS or Trump to withdraw half of 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, reports say. Both of these stories are properly sourced to credible media outlets. Besides original content, American Military News also curates and republishes military related news from other credible sources such as: Stars and Stripes (Least Biased), Hindustan Times (Left-Center), San Diego Union-Tribune (Least Biased), Roll Call (Least Biased), and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (Least Biased).\nAmerican Military News also has an opinion page that is reasonably balanced and does not offer extreme opinions. A general overview shows many editorials pertaining to gun ownership rights and pro-military positions, which makes sense given the genre of this website.\nA factual search reveals that American Military News has not failed any fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Further, American Military News offers a comprehensive fact-checking policy that you can read here.\nOverall, we rate American Military News Least Biased based on story selection that is balanced and free of loaded words, however there is a slight rightward lean editorally, but still offers balance. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record and use of low biased sources. (10/10/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 12/22/2018)",

The stated objective of the organization is “to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.” The core principle of Amnesty International is a focus on prisoners of conscience, those persons imprisoned or prevented from expressing any opinion other than violence. Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International’s founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights. Governments and their supporters have criticized Amnesty’s criticism of their policies, including those of Australia, Czech Republic,  China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iran, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Russia and the United States,for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor.

The Associated Press (AP) states its mission as “to inform the world” and describes its brief history as “In 1846, five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it. And The Associated Press was born.” \nThe evolution of relations between the world news agencies (Reuters, AFP, Associated Press) can be read here. Steven R. Swartz is Chairman of the AP, as well as President & CEO of Hearst and Gary B. Pruitt is the President and CEO of the Associated Press. Here is the complete list of AP Board of Directors and management committee.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Associated Press (AP) is a non profit news cooperative which had a profit of $1.6 million in 2016.  The AP is owned by its contributing newspapers, radio and television stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. It also sells content to other media organizations. According to an article titled “AP reports loss on one-time accounting charges” the Associated Press lost $74 million in 2017 and it states the reason as “mostly due to one-time accounting charges related to the federal tax overhaul passed late last year.” AP’s Chief Financial Officer is Ken Dale. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn their political coverage, AP utilizes moderate loaded language in their headlines such as “AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin.” However, the articles are always well sourced. When it comes to their economic coverage they maintain neutral language and least biased coverage: “US-China tariffs: What’s behind them, who stands to be hurt?” The AP also publishes well researched and sourced articles such as “Science Says: How family separation may affect kids’ brains”, utilizing pro-science sources such as American Academy of Pediatrics.\nA factual search reveals a clean track record for the Associated Press.\nOverall, we rate the Associated Press Least Biased based on balanced story selection and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

Additionally, BigNewsNetwork.Net, which is separate from BigNewsNetwork.com, consists of a network of news portals covering all the countries and their major cities, the regions, and U.S. states.  In their own words they “propagate news content resourced for each major region, country, city, and U.S. state, in addition to each major industry sector, business and sports.”\nBig News Network provides breaking news on topics such as Health, Internet, Technology, Sport, and Business & Finance. In November 2013 the company became a shareholder in Ireland’s iRadio FM radio network.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Owner and operator of Big News Network is Big News Network FZ LLC, a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates. Administering the News.Net network on behalf of Big News Network is Mainstream Media Limited, a company based in the UK, while the Big News Network’s eNewspapers are distributed by the Midwest Radio Network, a company incorporated in Sydney, Australia in 1938.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Big News Network utilizes minimally loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as “Giuliani admits he is aiming to delegitimize Mueller’s probe.” In news articles they use large blocks of quotes such as “U.S. Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein said that action would be taken if any infiltration was found and added, “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.” However, they fail to provide links to the original source of the quote. Big News Network is low biased and balanced in news reporting, but they simply fail to source their information properly.\nOverall, we rate Big News Network Least Biased based on story selection and Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing methods.

Revenue is generated through advertising, sponsored content and subscriptions to the website’s E-learning platform.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The Big Think publishes interviews, videos and news that utilizes minimally loaded words such as this, U.S. birthrate hits 32-year low. Here’s why that’s not (yet) a problem. This story is appropriately sourced to credible outlets. In fact, all stories are credibly sourced and science based. Editorially, there is minimal bias as evidenced by these mixed articles related to Donald Trump. \nWhen reviewing this site I was torn between placing this source in Pro-Science or Least Biased, but because they do some fact checks and also touch on some political issues I felt Least Biased is more appropriate. Everything here is sourced and delivered by experts in the given fields. \nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the Big Think Least Biased based on story selection that is generally pro-Science and objective. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 2/18/2017) Updated (5/18/2019)",

Bullshido also produces very snarky articles that make you laugh at loud, which could land them in the satire category.

It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. According to their about page “The Christian Science Monitor is an independent international news organization.  We want to help you to see news events as starting points for constructive conversations. We seek to cut through the froth of the political spin cycle to underlying truths and values. We want to be so focused on progress that together we can provide a credible and constructive counter-narrative to the hopelessness-, anger-, and fear-inducing brand of discourse that is so pervasive in the news.” The current editor is Mark Sappenfield.\nThe Christian Science Monitor has won seven Pulitzer Prizes and more than a dozen Overseas Press Club awards. Although the name contains the words Christian Science, the news reporting is generally not religious and those that are religious in nature are clearly labeled.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe CSM is owned by the Christian Science Publishing Society, which was established in 1898 by Mary Baker Eddy and is the publishing arm of The First Church of Christ Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts. The Christian Science Monitor is funded through a paid subscription and advertising model.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, The CSM reports news with minimally loaded wording and headlines such as this: US, China envoys seek compromise ahead of Trump tariff decision. All information is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the Associated Press. Editorially, the Christian Science Monitor does not endorse political candidates. The CSM describes why they do not endorse candidates by stating “The Monitor’s editors believe readers should decide for themselves who is best qualified for public office. Through our extensive political coverage from Capitol Hill and in races around the country, we strive to provide all the information necessary for voters to make political decisions most appropriate for them, their communities, and the nation.”\nIn general, the CSM is an excellent news source that is low biased, despite being affiliated with Christian Science, which routinely promotes pseudoscience.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate the Christian Science Monitor Least Biased based on balanced story selection and fair reporting coverage of both sides. Further, we rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 7/6/2016) Updated (2/16/2019)",

When reporting on President Trump the Des Moines Register offers a reasonable balance of pro-Trump and anti-Trump articles such as “Donald Trump has had one of the most successful starts of any new president in history.” A quote from the article reads: “An Islamified Western Europe is arguably one of the biggest stories of our time. Yet elites on both sides of the Atlantic are in denial about the coming Islamic takeover of much of Europe.” Another article is negative toward Trump with loaded emotional wording: “Pressure on Trump worked to end child separations. Now it must work to pass a law with heart.”\nThe Des Moines Register typically sources their information to credible sources such as the New York Times, Brookings.edu, LA Times, Whitehouse.gov, and the Washington Post. A factual search reveals the Des Moines Register has not failed a fact check. Further, they have served as a fact checker for Politifact during the 2016 Presidential Primaries.\nOverall, we rate the The Des Moines Register Least Biased based on mostly balanced coverage of politics, however there is a very slight leftward lean in story selection.

While the article has a very slight right bias, it is by a Washington DC reporter, Kery Murakari. a stringer for Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. (CNHI).

There is minimal bias in wording and relies strictly on SCOTUS information. They also have a biography section that details each Justice’s biography who served on the court since 1789. Oyez has a link to “news” that directs to ISCOTUS Now, which a blog run by Chicago-Kent College of Law. This blog also presents law news with minimal loaded words and proper sourcing.\nOverall, this is a valuable resource for researching SCOTUS cases without bias. We rate Oyez Least Biased and Very High for factual reporting.",

They describe their vision as “Politico strives to be the dominant source for politics and policy in power centers across every continent where access to reliable information, non-partisan journalism and real-time tools creates, informs and engages a global citizenry.” It distributes content via the internet, the Politico newspaper, radio, and podcasts. Its coverage in Washington, D.C., includes the U.S. Congress, lobbying, media and the presidency.

Politico.com does not require a subscription and their print newspaper is available for free in locations throughout Washington D.C., however outside of DC and overseas it is subject to a subscription fee. Both the website and print editions feature advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nBoth sides of the political spectrum have accused Politico of either having a left or right bias. For example, Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog group in Washington, has accused them of having a “Republican tilt.” Politico also published an article criticizing Obama for not being a strong supporter of Israel: “Obama’s Jewish Problem”. In another article they state that Liberals are not as tolerant as they say they are: “Why Liberals Aren’t as Tolerant as They Think.” Further, here is an article criticizing Democratic Socialism: “Down Goes Socialism” and another criticizing Bernie Sanders, “Bernie’s army in disarray.” Lastly, according to the Poynter Institute, Politico is balanced.\nThe right leaning Daily Caller has also criticized Politico for having a liberal bias when they compared a New York Times headline to Politico’s Playbook headline, by claiming that it “Extended further to the left than the NYT on this headline.” \nIn review, Politico occasionally publishes listicles such as “All of Trump’s Russia Ties, in 7 Charts.” They also publish articles with minimally loaded words such as “Ocasio-Cortez warns Trump Jr. about subpoena power in response to meme”, and they source to credible media outlets such as Reuters and the NY Times. However, they sometimes do use emotional headlines such as this: Establishment looks to crush liberals on Medicare for All.\nEditorially, they provide a balance of opinions as evidenced by the criticism they have received from both sides. Further, their news articles tend to be balanced through covering both sides and counterpoints to the story they are reporting on.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Politico Least Biased based on balanced coverage of news stories and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

In fact, there is a source called Politifact Bias that is dedicated to pointing out Politifact’s biases. Politifact is also a signatory of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), which outlines a code principles for credible fact checkers.\nPolitifact uses minimal loaded language in their articles and headlines such as this: Trump falsely claims NATO countries owe United States money for defense spending. All information is well sourced to credible media and/or direct statements from experts in the field or the politicians themselves. Fact Check selection leans slightly left as more right wing politicians are currently fact checked. This may be due to bias or the fact that Republicans currently control all branches of government and hence there is more to check. In fact, there was a recent academic study done that shows Politifact employs minimal bias through wording.\nOverall, this update reveals a slight leftward shift in Politifact’s fact checking selection, but not enough to move them from the least biased category.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1851, Reuters is the world’s leading international multimedia news agency. It is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Reuters was founded by Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, who moved to London and opened an office that transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. He had previously used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, which was also a common way to dispatch news. However, the Agence Havas (the predecessor of today’s AFP) was the first to start using the Morse telegraph. According to an article titled ”CHRONOLOGY: Reuters, from pigeons to multimedia merger”, overland telegraph and undersea cables enabled Reuters to expand its service beyond Europe to the Far East in 1872 and South America by 1874. During both World Wars, Reuters came under pressure from the British government to serve British interests. In 1941 Reuters avoided this pressure by restructuring itself as a private company. Stephen J. Adler is the President and Editor-in-Chief of Reuters.\nFunded by / Ownership\nIn April 2008, British company Reuters Group was acquired by Thomson Corporation and formed Thomson Reuters. Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, which is the world’s leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals and is owned by The Woodbridge Company Limited, which owns approximately 62.35% of common shares and is the principal and controlling shareholder of Thomson Reuters – see Fact Book 2017 (pg 83) and Annual Report 2017. The Woodbridge Company Limited is based in Toronto, Canada. The chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters is James (Jim) C. Smith, and the chairman is David Thomson, who is also a Chairman of Woodbridge. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2018, Reuters was named the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes on international reporting for exposing the methods of police killing squads in Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs and for feature photography documenting the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.\nIn review, when covering Trump administration news, Reuters Editor In Chief wrote this message to staff “Covering Trump the Reuters Way” urging them to stick with the Reuters “Trust Principles.” However, after the Capital Gazette shooting, Reuters Breaking news editor Rob Cox tweeted “This is what happens when @realDonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President. Save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul.” Cox later apologized and deleted the tweet. Regarding the incident Steve Adler, Editor-in-Chief, published a statement regarding Rob Cox’s tweet stating “Mr. Cox’s actions were inconsistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles requiring journalists to maintain freedom from bias. We do not condone his behavior and will take appropriate action.” \nIn reporting, Reuters uses minimally biased emotional language in their headlines such as “Oregon right-wingers clash with anti-fascists at march in Portland” and “Trump lawyer Cohen vows to defend himself, puts family first: ABC News”, sourcing credible local sources such as the Oregonian newspaper and ABC news. In most cases Reuters journalists are the primary source of stories and consistently report with minimal bias, covering both sides of issues.\nA factual search reveals that Reuters has an excellent track record with fact checkers.\nOverall, we rate Reuters Least Biased based on objective reporting and Very High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information with minimal bias. (7/10/2016) Updated (M.

Sky News has sister outlets around the world such as Australia, Arabia and Ireland. Sky News has won numerous awards including in 2018, being named Royal Television Society News Channel of the Year, the eleventh time the channel had won the award.\nFunded by / Ownership\nSky News is owned by Comcast as of November 2018 and is funded through advertising. Rupert Murdoch is no longer affiliated with Sky News UK, however Newscorp still has a share of Sky News Australia, which reports with a right leaning bias.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThis review covers UK website content only. Sky News reports on the UK, World, Politics, US, Ocean Rescue, Science & Tech, Business, Ents & Arts and Offbeat. Sky News utilizes moderate to minimal loaded language in headlines and articles such as this: Climate change demos in London: Police face challenges dealing with protesters. In another article there is use of moderate loaded language that covers both sides, May and Corbyn highlight persecution of Christians and refugee crisis in Easter messages. This article like most on Sky News does not provide hyperlinked sourcing, but rather relies on quotes and first person accounts. A review of the opinion page reflects mostly balanced coverage with some clearly in favor of the left.\nIn general, news reporting is balanced and low biased, with op-ed’s having a slight lean left. Under Rupert Murdoch, Sky News was frequently accused of having a right wing bias, however, the left leaning New Statesman does not agree, and concludes that Sky News is impartial.\nA factual search reveals that Sky News has not failed a fact check in recent years.\nOverall, we rate Sky News Least Biased based on balanced news coverage and a reasonably balanced op-ed page.

They also source content from numerous Left-Center, Right-Center and Least Biased sources such as Reuters. Therefore, the bias of the individual story a person reads is determined by the source they curate from. Since SmartNews publishes content from both sides we consider them a least biased source. We do however, rate them Mixed for factual reporting because some of the sources they curate have Mixed factual ratings themselves. Again, this is due to the individual sources and not SmartNews. This is a handy app for keeping up with a wide variety of news.\nOverall, we rate SmartNews Least biased based on news curation from both the right and the left, though a total count reveals slightly more from the left.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1994 by Barbara and David Mikkelson, Snopes.com, also known as the Urban Legends Reference Pages, was one of the first online fact-checking websites. It is a resource for validating and debunking such stories in American popular culture. Snopes ownership has said that the site receives more complaints of liberal bias than conservative bias, but insists that the same debunking standards are applied to all political claims and urban legends.\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to their about page, Snopes.com is an independent publication owned by Snopes Media Group. They derives funding from online advertising as well as donations. They fully disclose funding and expenses, as well as listing any donation over $10,000. For example, they list that Facebook paid them $100,000 and the James Randi Educational Foundation awarded them $75,000.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn 2012, FactCheck.org reviewed a sample of Snopes’ responses to political rumors regarding George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, and Barack Obama, and found them to be free from bias in all cases. Critics of the site have made the false claim that the website is funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, which has been debunked many times as they are funded through advertising and donations, in which they disclose.\nIn review, Snopes is a signatory of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) that is run by the Poynter Institute. Snopes has been independently verified by the IFCN, which lists its core principles as: “non-partisanship and fairness, transparency of sources, transparency of funding and organization, transparency of methodology, and open and honest corrections policy.” They meet this criteria, along with 50+ other fact checkers world wide. Of note, Media Bias Fact Check only uses IFCN fact checkers when checking claims and evaluating sources.\nSnopes always openly sources their information and avoids emotional wording, though they do occasionally publish news stories that offer some opinions. Snopes is frequently accused of liberal bias by some on the right. For example, the Daily Express of the UK and the Daily Caller have both criticized them for fact checks they felt were wrong or biased against the right. According to research performed by Real Clear Politics in the article: Snopes and Editorializing Fact Checks, they determined that out of the six fact checkers working with Facebook, “that Snopes is the least likely to fact-check matters of opinion.” This is important because opinion is something that cannot be fact checked. The article went on to say “We have found that since we started our project, Snopes has fact-checked opinions only 2 percent of the time. In other words, 98 percent of the time it sticks to matters of verifiable fact. Such an achievement is even more remarkable given that during this period, they produced the second-most articles of the six fact-checking outfits.”\nFinally, MBFC has an article detailing why we rate Snopes least biased that you can view here.\nOverall, we rate Snopes Least Biased and High for factual reporting based on transparency and proper sourcing of information.

In fact, most articles are well written with very low emotional bias. Economically, The Economist leans right, but they also support such initiatives as a carbon tax and environmental protectionism, which are not right wing positions. Editorially, The Economist endorses both Republicans and Democrats in the United States. For example, the have endorsed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2016, while endorsing Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush in earlier elections. In the UK they most recently endorsed the Liberal Democrats, which hold left leaning libertarian positions.

They do however, provide a media directory where you can view who is involved in writing and editing.\nA factual search reveals that The Economist has never failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate The Economist Least Biased based on balanced reporting and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record.

         "notes":"History\nFounded in 1942, Voice of America (VOA) is a United States government-funded multimedia news source and the official external broadcasting institution of the United States. VOA provides programming for broadcast on radio, TV, and the Internet outside of the U.S., in English and some foreign languages. Some consider Voice of America to be a form of pro-USA propaganda. However, VOA journalists are governed by its Best Practices Guide which says that “The accuracy, quality and credibility of the Voice of America are its most important assets, and they rest on the audiences’ perception of VOA as an objective and reliable source of U.S., regional and world news and information.” Surveys show that 84% of VOA’s audiences say they trust VOA to provide accurate and reliable information, and a similar percentage (84%) say that VOA helps them understand current events relevant to their lives. VOA is produced in 40 languages.\nFunded by / Ownership\nVOA is owned by The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formerly the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which is an independent agency of the United States government. Voice of America is tax payer funded through the United States government.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, VOA presents USA and world news from a United States perspective. There is minimal use of loaded language in news stories such as this: Officials Hope for Strife-Free Trump Visit to London and this Pompeo Seeks Common Ground on Iran, Huawei in Europe. Both of these stories are sourced to official video or credible sources. Some stories tend to lean slightly left through portraying President Trump negatively, such as this: Trump Unleashes Again on Special Counsel Who Didn’t Charge Him. When it comes to science the VOA follows the consensus model and therefore is pro-science. \nVoice of America has been called a propaganda arm of the US Government and perhaps it was at the start. Today, it is a straightforward journalism outfit that might lean slightly left, but is mostly least biased on a whole\nA factual search reveals Voice of America has not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Voice of America Least Biased based on balanced story selection and minimal use of loaded words. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (8/15/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/1/2019)",

According to Alexa Internet, as of September 2018, Wikipedia is the world’s fifth-most-popular website in terms of overall visitor traffic.\nFunded by / Ownership\nWikipedia is owned by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation Inc. The Wikimedia Foundation is primarily funded through donations. Further, Wikipedia runs fund raising campaigns each year on the website.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Wikipedia’s content is edited by volunteers rather than the Wikimedia Foundation. Although Wikipedia is edited essentially by anyone, a 2005 study published in the Journal Nature, showed that they were just as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica, when it comes to scientific information.  In another study completed in 2014 by the Public Library of Science, they compared Wikipedia’s accuracy on Drug information compared to other sources. The study showed that “Quantitative analysis revealed that accuracy of drug information in Wikipedia was 99.7%±0.2% when compared to the textbook data. The overall completeness of drug information in Wikipedia was 83.8±1.5% (p<0.001).” They concluded that “Wikipedia is an accurate and comprehensive source of drug-related information for undergraduate medical education.”\nWhen it comes to bias, it is nearly impossible to analyze, as each entry changes frequently and is edited by people with different opinions. In general, most Wikipedia entries cover both positives and negatives and link to mostly credible sources of information to support their claims. Since bias varies from entry to entry, and line to line, we rate them least biased as many perspectives are found on Wikipedia.\nOverall, we rate Wikipedia Least Biased based on a wide variety of content and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and several studies that reveal acceptable accuracy of information.

AIM describes itself as “a non-profit, grassroots citizens watchdog of the news media that critiques botched and bungled news stories and sets the record straight on important issues that have received slanted coverage.” It has been described as having a politically conservative stance (Wikipedia). This description via Wikipedia misses the mark.  This is a strongly right wing source that often resorts to conspiracy and bigotry. They also promote pseudoscience such as intelligent design and anti-science positions on climate change. (D. Van Zandt 8/9/2016)",

Headlines contain moderately loaded words and almost all stories are pro-right and anti-left. Not all articles are accurate or they are simply misleading. For example, there is a story on March 20th, 2017 entitled “Think Tank Report: Trump’s First 50 Days a Major Victory for Americans.” In this article they make various evidence based claims about President Trump’s accomplishments in the first 50 days. While what they list is factually accurate from a numbers standpoint, most of it has nothing to do with Trump. Here are some examples:\n“In both January and February, U.S. companies added jobs to the economy by leaps and bounds. In January, the numbers were 238,000 jobs added, and in February the figures were 235,000, with wages growing by an average 2.8 percent and unemployment falling to 4.7 percent.”\nThese numbers are correct, but January job growth is credited to Obama and is the same growth our economy has been experiencing for 6 straight years. This has nothing to do with Trump.\n“The most recent figure for the debt under ex-President Obama was $19.947 trillion, but since then, Trump has subtracted $68 billion — not a bad start for a president who has vowed to cut copious government waste.”\nThis also has nothing to do with Trump as his budget will not begin until October 2017. These are Obama’s numbers until that time. This is mostly false.\n“Since Trump was elected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged more than 12 percent — greater than 2500 points — to close above 21,000 for the first time ever on March 1.”\nWhile these numbers are again accurate, they ignore the fact that the stock market has grown consistently since 2009. While some of this may be attributed to enthusiasm for Trump, one cannot claim he did it alone.\nOverall, we give Conservative Base a right bias rating vs. questionable…But it is close. (D.

Original content uses moderately loaded words that almost always favors the right. Example: Levin: Want to see REAL campaign finance violations? Look at these creeps in Congress. New content that is linked to other sources typically comes from right leaning sources such as The Federalist and factually mixed sources such as the Daily Wire and The Blaze.\nConservative Review is best known for their Liberty Score, in which they rate politicians on their conservative voting records. The Liberty Score has been used widely and is occasionally used to aid in fact checking.\nIt is not possible to accurately review CRTV as it consists of multiple opinion based radio hosts. What we do know is the majority of the hosts have failed fact checks via IFCN fact checkers. For example, Michelle Malkin has an extensive record of failed fact checks and misleading claims.\nOverall, we rate Conservative Review Right Biased based on conservative political positions and Mixed for factual reporting due to use of poor sources and radio personalities who have poor records with fact checkers.

Unfortunately, the website lacks transparency and does not disclose funding.

This research was conducted by John Lott. In viewing the research present on their page, all of the research is favorable toward gun ownership and minimizes gun dangers.

FNC is available in 90 million homes and it operates the Fox Business Network and Fox News Radio. Fox also owns the National Geographic Channel, both the U.S. and international versions. Fox News Channel is headquartered in New York, NY.\nFNC was created by Australian born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former Republican political consultant Roger Ailes is the founding CEO. Roger Ailes was forced to resign in 2016 amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment. Jay Wallace was promoted to president of the network and Suzanne Scott has been named CEO of FNC as of May 2018. She will report to Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch. Lachlan Murdoch, is the executive chairman and co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox (FOXA). On May 7, 2018, Comcast announced a potential bid, making a $65 billion cash offer challenging Disney’s offer for Fox.\nAs of October 2018, Fox News has added to their terms of use that they are an entertainment company: “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe company is owned by Rupert Murdoch who is a board member of News Corp 21st Century Fox. James Murdoch (son) is chief executive of 21st Century Fox and recently left in May 2018 according to Reuters. Lachlan (the other son of Murdoch) and Rupert Murdoch will serve as co-chairmens of the new Fox. Revenue analysis can be found at Investopedia and income reports here.  \nAnalysis / Bias\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew Survey indicates “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.”  \nFox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective and also has a number of on air personalities that are strong supporters of Trump, such as Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Tomi Lahren. FNC typically skews conservative as there is less criticism of Trump, therefore the majority of stories are pro-Trump. \nIn review, FNC publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “’They Wanted It to Blow Up’: Limbaugh Says Success of Trump-Kim Summit Caught Media Off Guard” and “Tucker: 2016 Russia Collusion ‘Witch Hunt’ Now Extends to Jill Stein.” When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize pro-Trump pundits such as Rush Limbaugh who has a very poor record with fact checkers, as well as credible sources such as the Wall Street Journal. Fox News is also known to publish right wing conspiracy theories, although after being sued they retracted the story. FNC has also been deemed the least accurate cable news source according to Politifact.\nOverall, we rate Fox News strongly Right-Biased due to wording and story selection that favors the right and Mixed factually based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared.

According to Financial Times “Mark Dubowitz, is an Iran hawk who advises the Trump administration, wants Mr. Trump to decertify the current deal to secure further leverage with Europeans.” Foundation for Defense of Democracies mission statement indicates “to promote pluralism, defend democratic values and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to a left leaning ThinkProgress article dated July 19, 2011 about the major donors of FDD “Most of the major donors are active philanthropists to ‘pro-Israel’ causes both in the U.S. and internationally. With the disclosure of its donor rolls, it becomes increasingly apparent that FDD’s advocacy of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, its hawkish stance against Iran, and its defense of right-wing Israeli policy is consistent with its donors’ interests in ‘pro-Israel’ advocacy.” According to Right Web “Shortly after its founding, FDD quickly became a prominent member of a group of neoconservative think tanks and advocacy groups—including the American Enterprise Institute and the Hudson Institute—that were influential in shaping the early foreign policy priorities of the George W. Bush administration.”\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies utilizes credible right-center biased sources such as the Washington Times and also founder Clifford May’s articles are published by the Washington Times. FDD uses minimally emotional language in their headlines such as “The man who would be Saudi King.” Most articles and information on the website favor Neoconservative positions that are pro-military and pro-Israel. \nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Foundation for Defense of Democracies Right Biased based on political affiliation and story selection. Further, we rate them High for factual reporting based on the use of proper sources. (M. Huitsing 11/29/2017) Updated (11/30/2018)",

There is moderate use of loaded language in their articles that significantly favors the right, such as this: Democratic Socialism: Who Knew That ‘Free’ Could Cost So Much? For the most part IBD sources their market information to credible mainstream and government websites, however they occasionally utilize factually mixed sources such as the Daily Signal.\nInvestors Business Daily strays from the consensus of science in regards to climate change and they have made outrageous and false claims, such as Stephen Hawking would be dead if he lived under England’s Government health care system. This is a false propaganda statement as Stephen Hawking is a citizen of the UK and lives there. Hawking claims the British Healthcare system saved his life and kept him alive to old age.\nA factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Here are a few of the many we found:\n\nIBD editorial board claims that cap-and-trade is unpopular in America – FALSE\nPrivate health insurance not banned on page 16 of the House bill – PANTS ON FIRE\nInvestor’s Business Daily editorial misrepresents study to claim plants will prevent dangerous climate change – FALSE\nWas it recently revealed that the U.S. found uranium in Iraq after the invasion in 2003 – FALSE\n\nOverall, we would rate Investors Business Daily Right Biased based on right leaning economic and market positions. We would also give them a High factual rating on strictly investing and market news.

The Chairman and co-founder of Kansas Policy Institute is George Pearson.

George Pearson according to a Politico article is a former member of the John Birch Society in Wichita, which has been described as a radical right organization that promotes conspiracies. In this article, sourcing a book written by Clayton A. Coppin, who is a researcher from George Mason University, summarizes Pearson’s arguments “It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his political actions.”\nDave Trabert is the President of the Kansas Policy Institute and according to Sourcewatch is a member of ALEC’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Task Force and Barry Poulson and Jonathan Williams both from KPI, are also associated with the same ALEC task force.  Poulson as an adviser and Williams on staff as the task force director. “ALEC has pushed for repealing the Affordable Care Act, has opposed Medicaid expansion, and has endorsed rolling back environmental regulations. Alec pushed the Trump administration to rescind federal findings that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful, a move that even ExxonMobil opposes.”\nThe Kansas Policy Institute’s mission statement indicates “We engage citizens and policy makers with research and information to enact public policy solutions that protect the constitutional right to freedom of all Kansans, give them greater access to better educational opportunities, and allow them to keep more of what they earn.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Kansas Policy Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is held by a board of trustees and is funded through donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, KPI uses strong emotional language in their headlines such as “19 U.S. Senators promoting tyranny”.

Rothbard’s Austrian School of free market economics and anarcho-capitalism. Mises Institute was founded in 1982 by Lew Rockwell, Murray Rothbard, and Burton Blumert. Mises Institute states its mission as “to promote the Misesian tradition of thought through the defense of the market economy, private property, sound money, and peaceful international relations, while opposing government intervention.”  \nFunded by / Ownership\nAccording to independent.org, Ludwig von Mises initially was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. A quote from the article states “Mises himself in the years immediately after he came to the United States were kept afloat financially through generous grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.” Mises Institute states that The institute “operates as a non-profit corporation using funds donated almost entirely by individuals. Our donors are our shareholders.” However, they don’t reveal those donors. Here you can view the 2017 unaudited financial data. \nThe Board consists of founder and chairman of the Mises Institute Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr., board member and Counselor Dr. Ron Paul and the President is former Ron Paul adviser and chief of staff, Jeff Deist.  Please find the complete list of board members here. \nAnalysis / Bias\nMises Institute consists of sections such as Mises Wire, Blog Media, virtual courses under the Learn Online section and a store where they sell books.\nIn review, Mises Institute publishes articles with a critical tone of the Trump administration and they use strong emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as “AS DEMOCRATS PUSH A “WEALTH TAX,” HERE’S WHY OTHER COUNTRIES GOT RID OF IT” and “Trump Shows Us Why Its So Hard to “Drain the Swamp”. This second article is authored by Paul-Martin Foss and a quote from the article reads “If Trump supporters don’t wake up and recognize what is transpiring very soon, by the time they realize that they’ve been hoodwinked and that Trump has become the establishment’s Manchurian president it will be too late.” Finally, Mises frequently publishes articles that attempt to portray socialism negatively such as this: Two Reasons Why Socialism Repeatedly Fails. In general, story selection mostly favors the Libertarian right.\nAlthough, they utilize credible sources such as AOL, Vanity Fair, Washington Examiner, New York Times, The Guardian, Washington Post, Scientific American, NPR , Daily Beast, The American Conservative, Reason.com and mixed sources such as the Wall Street Journal, they also utilize conservative blogs such as danieljmitchell to back their claims. \nWhen it comes to science, Mises does not deny the existence of human influenced climate change. However, they consistently downplay the consequences and reject government intervention as a solution. Further, their founder Lew Rockwell, has published outright climate change denial on his blog. Mises has also promoted pseudoscience through claiming that MMR vaccines cause autism: CDC, PHARMA, And Mainstream Media On The Same Team.\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mises Institute scholars promoted “anti-immigrant views” and “promotes a type of Darwinian view of society in which elites are seen as natural and any intervention by the government on behalf of social justice is destructive.” Further, Ludwig von Mises states in Human Action “It is nonsensical to fight the racial hypothesis by negating obvious facts. It is vain to deny that up to now certain races have contributed nothing or very little to the development of civilization and can, in this sense, be called inferior.”\nOverall, we rate the Mises Institute Right Biased based on strong advocacy for free market capitalism and limited government (Libertarian), as well as right leaning positions regarding climate change. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the promotion of Pseudoscience and misleading statements regarding race and climate change. (7/16/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 6/28/2019)",

         "notes":"History\nThe National Review was founded in 1955 by conservative editor, columnist, author and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. (1925-2008). According to their about page the print magazine and website are corporately known as National Review, Inc. and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Review Institute (NRI) based in New York City.  In addition to the content published in its print version, the magazine’s web site covers articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, opinion pieces, conservative news, and commentary. \nWilliam F. Buckley Jr. appeared in a series of televised debates with Gore Vidal during the 1968 Republican National Convention and this resulted in him suing Vidal and Esquire Magazine due to Vidal calling Buckley “racist, anti-black, anti-semitic and a pro-crypto Nazi.” Buckley eventually settled with Esquire receiving a $115,000 payment and dropped his suit against Vidal. \nThe National Review promoted Barry Goldwater during the early 1960s and Reagan during the 80’s. E. Garrett Bewkes IV is the publisher of National Review. Richard Lowry is the Editor-in-Chief of National Review Magazine and the online Editor is Charles C. W. Cooke. The chairman is John Hillen and Lindsay Young Craig is the president. The full masthead can be viewed here.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe National Review magazine and website are both owned by the National Review Institute. The National Review Institute was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. as a nonprofit and according to an article from The Nation the “National Review‘s biggest financial supporter, Roger Milliken was a Birch Society member. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the John Birch Society as a conspiracist group, whereas the National Review describes Milliken as one of the “Right’s funding fathers”. According to Sourcewatch, The National Review Institute has received funding from the Charles G. Koch Foundation as well as grants from the right-wing Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports the Bradley Foundation helps fund groups opposing climate regulation.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe National Review Online, describes itself as “America’s most widely read and influential magazine and web site for conservative news, commentary, and opinion.”\nIn review, the National Review Online frequently uses loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor the right such as: Weapons of Mass Manipulation. This article was written by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin who has made false claims according to fact checkers. When reporting on President Trump the National Review offers a reasonable balance of pro-Trump and anti-Trump articles with slightly more favoring the President and his policies. National Review typically sources their information to known right leaning sources, but sometimes links to factually mixed sources such as PJ Media and the Daily Mail. Editorially, they endorse conservative policy and politicians, such as their endorsement of Ted Cruz during the 2016 Presidential Election. Finally, story selection always favors the right, while painting liberal policy negatively.\nA factual search reveals that in this article the National Review sourced the Daily Mail who falsely reported that NOAA manipulated climate data. This was later debunked by the person they were quoting (Dr. Bates). Further, the National Review did not include the actual statements that Dr. Bates made, which refute the Daily Mail and National Review’s claims of unverified and corrected data. Bates said there was “no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious.” “It’s really a story of not disclosing what you did,” Bates said in the interview. “It’s not trumped up data in any way shape or form.” FactCheck.org concluded that the National Review’s article was misleading.\nOverall, we rate the National Review Right Biased based on story selection that always favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to misleading claims and occasional use of poor sources.

Brent Bozell III. MRC claims to be “America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing and neutralizing liberal media bias.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nNewsbusters is owned by the Media Research Center, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The MRC has received financial support from several right leaning sources, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock, Carthage and JM foundations, as well as ExxonMobil. Newsbusters is funded by MRC and also displays advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Newsbusters reports news on liberal bias. They frequently use strongly loaded, emotional and right biased wording such as this: CBS’s Garrett Hammers NBC for Boosting Warren During Debate. This story is sourced to video footage and tweets. Another example of emotionally charged language can be found here: NBC’s Liberal Debate Obsessions: Save Miami! Grab Guns! Fight Mitch McConnell! When it comes to sourcing they usually provide video to support their opinions, however other times they use poor sources such as Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. Editorially, Newsbusters always favors conservatives and denigrates the left. \nA factual search reveals a poor track record with IFCN fact checkers.\n\nTed Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact. – FALSE \nWarren Buffett recently said “Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over.” – PANTS ON FIRE\nSays after Hurricane Sandy, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg “refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!” – MOSTLY FALSE\nThe Communist Party of the USA endorsed Hillary Clinton. – FALSE\n\nOverall, we rate Newsbusters Right Biased based on story selection that always favors the right. We also rate them borderline questionable due to the use of poor sources and numerous failed fact checks. One additional failed fact check will push this source by default onto the Questionable list.

For example: “Suffer with Low Energy, Weight Gain & Fatigue”, which leads to a new website promoting products. In another category called Specials, they publish news with sensational headlines such as: “Nobel Prize Winning Discovery Makes Your Cells Nearly “Immortal” SPECIAL: New way to grow biologically younger,“ which again leads to an advertisement.\nWhen reporting real news, Newsmax uses minimally loaded words in their headlines and articles such as “NYT: Growing Puerto Rican Population Could Offset GOP Cubans” and moderately loaded: “FEMA’s Long: No Time For San Juan Mayor’s ‘Political Noise’. Newsmax also aggregates news stories from credible sources such as Reuters and the AP.

We don’t think being a patriot is anything to be ashamed of; to the contrary, we wear the badge with honor. We will until the day we die or the country becomes something completely unrecognizable.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nPatriot News Daily does not disclose ownership on the website. PND appears to be funded mostly through online advertising \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Patriot News Daily is a borderline extreme right wing biased news and opinion website. All news stories favor the right and disparage the left. The Patriot News Daily uses highly sensationalized headlines that serve as click bait. Not all information is sourced and at times they use questionable sources such as Rush Limbaugh, who has a very poor track record with fact checkers. \nOverall, this a borderline questionable far right wing biased website that is Mixed for factual reporting due to the use of poor sources.

PJ Media was founded by Charles Johnson and Roger L. Simon. Johnson and Simon set out to “challenge the mainstream media with a network of citizen-journalists.” The network was primarily made up of conservatives and libertarians. PJ Media also had a TV channel that shutdown operations on May 11, 2016, after its billionaire majority investor Aubrey Chernick pulled out funds.\nFunded by / Ownership\nPJ Media is privately held by PJ Media, LLC. The website is funded through a combination of online advertising and an online shop to buy products.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, PJ Media is a popular conservative news and opinion website that garners 13 million+ page views per month. PJ Media uses moderately loaded emotional language in their articles that favor the right, such as this: Suspended Pentagon Whistleblower Says FBI’s Russia Probe Was ‘All a Set-Up’. When it comes to sourcing of information, they usually use credible right leaning media sources. In general, almost all stories reviewed favored the right and denigrated the left through wording and story selection.\nA factual search reveals multiple instances of failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers.\n\nDo ‘Liberals’ at the University of Texas Want to Designate Masculinity a Mental Illness? – FALSE\nBetween 2008 and 2014, “criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York.” – FALSE\n“During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies.” – FALSE\nClinton Sent Ambassador Stevens to Benghazi to Retrieve Stinger Missiles – UNPROVEN!\nNo, 96% of Google news stories on Trump aren’t from left-wing outlets – FALSE\n\nOverall, we rate PJ Media to be borderline Questionable based on numerous failed fact checks, however they do fall just below the threshold and are therefore rated Right Biased and Mixed for factual reporting.

         "notes":"History\nLaunched in May 2008, Standpoint Magazine is a monthly cultural and political magazine published by Social Affairs Unit Magazines Ltd, a right wing think tank based in London, UK.\nStandpoint Magazine was founded by Daniel Johnson and he is the current director. Standpoint Magazine describes itself as “the only magazine that is dedicated to the defense of Western civilization, the values we have inherited from our Judaeo-Christian, classical, medieval, Renaissance and Enlightenment past.” Standpoint Magazine covers politics, religion, science, the arts and the humanities.\nFunded by / Ownership\nStandpoint Magazine is funded through online advertising, donations and subscription rates.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Standpoint Magazine utilizes emotionally loaded language that favors the right in their headlines such as “Watchmen of the West “ and “The Great Betrayal: How Liberals Appease Islam.“\nRegarding US politics their word choices are pro-Trump. The following is a quote from an article: “President Trump may not be the ideal leader of the free world. But he understands what is at stake, he knows what must be done and he has the willpower to see it through. It is time for the high-minded to set aside their low expectations and judge Mr Trump by his actions rather than his words. There is method in his “madman diplomacy”. And it seems to be working.“\nOn national politics, the editorial opinion of Standpoint Magazine is conservative, usually supporting Theresa May. In this article they are drawing parallels between May and Thatcher with this quote: “Mrs May shares the same instinct: she sides with the little people who often struggle to survive in a global marketplace. Like Mrs Thatcher, she believes in a property-owning democracy, a nation in which hard work and solid achievement, rather than slick presentation or nifty networking, are rewarded. Like Mrs Thatcher, her parents were too poor to pay school fees.”\nWhen soliciting for donations, Standpoint utilizes conservative fears over terrorism and immigration as a threat to society: “In the era of global terrorism and uncontrolled migration, internal and external threats to our values and identity, that mission to preserve Western civilization has never been more necessary.”\nStandpoint does not source their information well, using quotes rather than hyperlinked or MLA formatted sourcing.\nOverall, we rate Standpoint Magazine Right Biased due to word and story choices that favor the Right and mixed factually due to poor sourcing.

Our aim is to be a forum for free speech and honesty about the issues facing the United Kingdom and the World today.” The Editor-In-Chief is Carl D. Pearson.

Story selection often favors the political right and uses strongly loaded words such as this: SHOCK REPORTS that Nigel Farage has been BANNED from meeting President TRUMP! and this Macron RAGES as he BLAMES British people for DESTROYING hopes of United States of Europe! When it comes to sourcing, they primarily use quotes and occasionally hyperlinks to media sources. Some of the media sources utilized are The Telegraph, Bloomberg News and local papers such as Devon Live.\nIn general, news almost always favors the right with many articles being anti-immigrant that focuses on their crimes, but not others.

There is moderate use of loaded language such as this: Cornell Leftists Predictably Lose Touch With Reality Ahead of YAF Lecture by VP Dick Cheney. YAF usually sources their information to credible High factual sources. \nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Young America’s Foundation Right Biased based on story selection that favors the right and High for factual reporting based on a clean fact check record and use of credible sources.

It was founded in 2007 by a group of neuroscientists, including Henry and Kamila Markram, and later expanded to other academic fields. Frontiers is based in Lausanne, Switzerland. They publish 67 journals as of 2019. According to their about page “Frontiers ranks as the 4th most-cited publisher among the 20 largest publishers with an average of 3.65 citations per article.\nFunded by / Ownership\nFrontiers is a for-profit corporation operated by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group. Funding comes digital sales of content and author fees for publication. \nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Frontiers publishes scientific research studies in a wide range of journals. For the most part all of these are sound science with legitimate peer review. However, in 2015 Frontiers Media was added to Beall’s list of Predatory Open Access Journals. In short, Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals (open access or not). Frontiers has also retracted some studies that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer reviewed. Overall, we still rate Frontiers pro-science, but barely. Of the thousands of journal articles they have published only a select few were retracted and the act of retraction shows diligence toward credible science.\nOverall, we rate Frontiers a Pro-Science source, however due to being an open access publishing company we advise caution as not all information is properly peer reviewed.

Content is targeted to an educated audience of both healthcare professionals and patients alike. The editorial team provides news from evidence-based, peer-reviewed studies, along with accurate, unbiased and informative content from governmental organisations (e.g. FDA, CDC, NIH, NHS), medical societies, royal colleges, professional associations, patients’ groups, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, among others.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nMedical News Today is owned by Healthline Media, Inc and is funded through advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Medical News Today generally publishes very well sourced credible medical news that is Pro-Science, however, they also cover alternative medicine, which would be fine if they were discrediting it. While they don’t endorse alternative medicine, they also don’t refute it and tend to give it equal standing with traditional well researched medicine. For this reason we feel there should be caution when using this source, but for the most part this is pro-science.\nA factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.\nOverall, we rate Medical News Today Pro-Science and High for factual reporting as most of their information is well sourced and based on traditional medicine. We recommend caution and further research on any articles related to alternative medicine, which is considered a pseudoscience. (D. Van Zandt 4/1/2018) Updated (5/11/2019)",

The magazine focuses on behavior and covers a range of topics including psychology, neuroscience, relationships, sexuality, parenting, health (including from the perspectives of alternative medicine), work, and the psychological aspects of current affairs. The current Editor-in-Chief is Kaja Perina.\nFunded by / Ownership\nPsychology Today is owned by Sussex Publishers. They are funded through a combination of print sales, subscriptions, advertisements and a directory of mental health professionals who pay to be listed.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Psychology Today publishes news about the science of psychology through the magazine and website, which features over 100 blog writers. Blog writers are psychology professionals, many of which exhibit bias. While this is not a true scientific publication they do cover the science of psychology with experts. \nOverall, we rate Psychology Today as a pro-Science source though there is individual bias among the various writers.

They also seem to have ties to, or at least to be pro-Russian in much of their content.  Specifically Russian Today (RT) the state run Russian news outlet.\nFunded by / Ownership\n21st Century Wire is owned by Patrick Henningsen and is funded primarily through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\n21st Century Wire is an alternative news website that rejects the consensus of science regarding climate change and also promotes the conspiracy that mainstream media is publishing fake news. This source has also received an unproven claim by Snopes, which 21st Century Wire considers a questionable source. The website Fort Liberty has placed 21st Century Wire on it’s Fake News/Hoax list. 21st Century employs somewhat sensational headlines and does provide sourcing to attempt to support claims, however most are to themselves. The primary issue is that 21st Century publishes some questionable stories (see examples above) that are embedded among legitimate stories they publish. This can mislead the reader. \nA factual search reveals 21st Century Wire has a poor record with fact checkers. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016)\n(Dennis Kelly): 21st Century Wire is a conspiracy and fake news website with an extreme right bias. Additionally, their headlines are sensationalist and largely misleading.\nTheir stories are non-sourced, with no links except to their own stories, and are little more than loosely associated facts tied together with broad conjecture and innuendo. When trying to research some of their claims myself I could find no corroboration from a credible source. Ironically, they are currently in a self proclaimed war against “Fake News”, and the site features several stories on the subject. These war on “fake news” stories, as with their other content, contain little fact and lots of conjecture, with links to their other stories instead of links to external sources. I have provided a breakdown of one of their stories below.\nIn the story “The Mainstream Media Contortionists And Their Fake News Circus”. They begin by discussing Agnes Gruta, a journalist writing for La Presse, questioning the bias of Eva Bartlett, a journalist writing for Russia Today. While they admit Ms. Bartlett’s ties to RT, instead of addressing the possible bias of Ms. Bartlett they launch into an attack on Ms. Gruta instead. After this they delve into a broad attack of the purported bias of several other media outlets. There is also an addendum to the story by Ms. Bartlett herself, which is unusual in itself as rebuttals are usually published separately. The rebuttal purports to defend both herself and RT from the question of bias. It falls short however, as Ms. Bartlett, in her own words, admits that her work is biased:\n“…no corporate newspaper would publish what I wrote–not without heavy editing and censorship and changing of my chosen lexicon.” \nOn a personal note, I would have trouble trusting any news source that did not exercise at least some editorial control over what they publish, even an opinion piece. I also have trouble trusting a news source that only cites itself as corroboration of it’s “facts”. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016), (D. Kelley 2/15/2017) Updated (10/11/2018)",

For example, they offer the unsupported claim that vaccinations are a cause for Autism. ACN also routinely publishes anti-GMO propaganda as well many miracle cures that are not endorsed by the consensus of the medical community. Lastly, this source publishes misleading information, such as wi-fi causing too much radiation exposure that may lead to health problems. This simply is not true. \nOverall, some of the information presented on this website is medically sound and backed by evidence, however much of it is not rooted in science.

Autism Speaks is an organization that raises tens of millions of dollars each year by hosting walks and star-studded events like an annual concert in Hollywood called Light Up the Blues. While Autism Speaks is one of the largest and most influential Autism groups they are not without controversy. Up until recently they promoted anti-vaccination based on the false notion that vaxx is a risk factor for autism. This goes 100% against the consensus of science. Thankfully, they have changed their position stating: “have not found a link between vaccines and autism,” and that they “strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease.” Another significant controversy is the board of Autism Speaks does not have a single person with autism representing the organization. This has caused persons with autism to form counter groups and protest this organizations leadership. Lastly, this organization sometimes promotes and funds non-evidence based therapies such as Floortime.

In another article, they report about witches (liberals) gathering together to put a spell on Trump. Further, in this article they cite the source WND, which has a terrible track record with fact checkers. Lastly, Catholic Online publishes far right conspiracies such as Hillary Clinton being very sick and dying. Obviously, this is/was without evidence as she is healthy today.

Pat Robertson is known for making extreme right wing and conspiratorial claims.\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe Christian Broadcasting Network is owned by the The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. and is funded through advertising and donations.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, CBN News combines both secular and religious news with a strong christian right bias. There is moderate use of loaded emotional language such as this: Half of Pastors Worry They’ll Offend Someone if They Preach on Controversial Topics. This story is appropriately sourced to credible media such as CBS News. Editorially CBN holds right leaning view points and reports favorably on President Trump. When it comes to science, CBN holds a skeptical view of climate change and evolution.\nCBN also features a TV program called the 700 Club, with Pat Robertson serving as host. Pat Robertson has made numerous false claims and promoted conspiracy theories such as claiming that natural disasters occur due to gay immoral acts. Below is a short list of failed fact checks by Pat Robertson.\n\nMargaret Sanger “wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman.” – Pants of Fire\nPresident Barack Obama attended  “an Islamic madrassa.” – Mostly False\nPat Robertson said the feminist agenda encourages women to “kill their children, practice witchcraft, and become lesbians.” – Correct Attribution\n\nThe SPLC has also reported on Pat Robertson making statements that they consider hate speech.\nOverall, we rate the Christian Broadcasting Network a right leaning promoter of conspiracy theories via Pat Robertson on the 700 Club. CBN News however, mostly reports accurate news that sometimes does not align with science. (D. Van Zandt 3/24/2017) Updated (4/13/2019)",

         "name":"Disobedient Media",
         "notes":"History\nFounded in 2016, Disobedient Media is a news and opinion website with the tagline “Truth has no Bias.” The website was co-founded by Elizabeth Vos and William Craddick. Other than listing a few names associated with the website such as Adam Carter, who’s real name is Tim Leonard, the about page lacks information, such as what they do and/or a mission statement. It also does not disclose ownership and funding.\nFunded by / Ownership\nDisobedient Media does not clearly state ownership, though one would expect it is co-owned by the founders. Revenue appears to come from a Patreon donation account, however since there isn’t disclosure, we are uncertain of other revenue streams such as donations or sponsors.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Disobedient Media publishes news and opinions with a strong right-wing bias through story selection and wording. There is significant use of loaded emotional language in headlines such as this: Opinion: In A Sane World Brenda Snipes Would Be In Prison, Not Reinstated and this It’s Been A Spectacularly Bad Month For Hillary Clinton: Here’s Why. In general, story selection is very negative when reporting on Democrats. When it comes to sourcing, Disobedient Media tends to source properly to mostly mainstream sources such as CNN, Fox News, Reuters, and the Daily Beast. However, they sometimes use conspiracy sources such as ZeroHedge and show support for Alex Jones, a very popular right-wing conspiracy theorist.\nA common theme of the website is focusing on leaks from Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0, as well as criticism of the DNC and frequently attempting to deny Russian interference in the 2016 election. For example, in this article, Leaked State Department Emails Reveal Connection To Donald Jr. Meeting, they state “Some have claimed that the emails sent to Donald Jr. were intentionally worded to create a basis for a FISA request to surveil and unmask the Trump team.” The “some” who claimed this is the conspiracy website, ZeroHedge. The gist of the article is that Democrats (deep state) set up Don Jr. so that the Democrats can surveil and attack the Trump campaign. While that could be possible, there is zero evidence to support that claim, which makes it a conspiracy theory.\nDisobedient Media also publishes sensationalized headlines that do not match the story, such as this one: The Hollywood Complex At The Heart Of A Celebrity Child Sex Ring. This story is sourced to a Deadline article that describes how two sex offenders were found living in the 1,100 unit Oakwood Apartments, which is famous for having a lot of child actors living there. The Deadline article does not mention a sex ring and indicates that once the Apartment management discovered the two sex offenders, they were evicted. Further, the sex offenders did not commit a crime while living there. Disobedient Media then goes on to describe how “At least one resident of the Oakwood Apartment Complex was tied financially to the DEN child sex scandal which erupted in Hollywood in the aftermath of the dot-com burst. Actor Fred Savage is listed by multiple media outlets as having lived in the complex during his younger years. As reported yesterday by Disobedient Media, Savage was financially tied to DEN, though he was never accused of any sex offenses against minors.”\nAgain, there is no mention of a Sex ring anywhere in the Disobedient Media article, only in the headline. This is highly misleading click bait.\nSeveral media outlets have criticized Disobedient Media such as StopFake who state the Disobedient Media website “focuses on conspiracy theories, especially ones with a hint of pedophilia, together with posts attacking Hillary Clinton and her circle. In a Quartz article they state that the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research (DFR) has reported that William Craddick of Disobedient Media is a “distributor of fraudulent news stories.” The EU Observer has called Disobedient Media a “far-right US website.”\nFrom MBFC Researcher D. Kelley: Disobedient Media (DM) is, like many sensational sites, with a mix of a few facts peppered with conjecture, tenuous connections, and opinion. The stories are rife with hyperbole and biased wording intended to lead the reader to a conclusion that is often at odds with the actual facts provided. A good example of confirmation bias as opposed to responsible journalism. The stories on DM often point to either their own stories or similar stories on other right-wing and conspiracy sites.\nExample: DM is a staunch defender of Julian Assange, Wikileaks, and Guccifer 2.0. All of which have known and factually proven ties to Russia. In multiple articles they claim that Guccifer is not a Russian operative, or is being framed as such, when multiple factual sources, such as Ars Technica, have verified that not only did the files they shared came from Russian sources, but that Guccifer is actually a persona run by GRU, the Russian Intelligence Service.\nThe fact that DM includes some facts in their stories does not allay the sensational and conspiratorial spin they put on them. For this reason, DM is given a Conspiracy rating.\nOverall, we rate Disobedient Media a strongly right biased Conspiracy source, based on numerous examples of publishing information that is not conclusive or supported by evidence.

Revenue is derived from online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Health Impact News publishes health related news stories that they state are alternative. Our analysis concurs that they are certainly alternative to conventional science and medicine. They are fiercely anti-vaccine with articles such as this: Dangerous Vaccines Found to Cause Symptoms of Shaken Baby Syndrome. This story comes from the discredited VacTruth website. They also routinely publish anti-GMO propaganda such as this. They are also purveyors of misinformation regarding Chemtrails and Geoengineering such as this: Covert Chemical Geoengineering Programs – A Real Threat to Public Health. \nA factual search reveals an abysmal fact checking record with IFCN fact checkers. There are too many failed fact checks to list. Follow the factual search link for all of them\nOverall, we rate Health Impact News a Quackery level pseudoscience website for the promotion of anti-vaccination propaganda as well as chemtrails, geoengineering and false information regarding GMO’s.

Erin Elizabeth is the girlfriend of Dr. Joseph Mercola, who is a well known promoter of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. According their about page “As a long time “health nut,” author and public speaker, Erin Elizabeth has had a passion for the healing arts for nearly 25 years. Erin began Health Nut News in January 2014 with humble beginnings.”\nThe website lists only Erin Elizabeth as the author/poster of articles.\nFunded by / Ownership \nHealth Nut News is owned by Erin Elizabeth and derives revenue from online advertising and the sale of health related products.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, Health Nut News (Erin Elizabeth) is a website that publishes news on alternative health, the environment, recipes and politics. Headlines often feature strong emotional language such as this: Connecticut DCF punishing Tennessee parents for taking their story public? Refuse to let parents visit baby. This story comes directly from Health Impact News, which is a Conspiracy and Pseudoscience website that promotes anti-vaccine propaganda, as well chemtrail conspiracies. Health Nut News frequently utilizes unreliable sources such as Mercola and Natural News, which both have numerous false claims attributed to them.\nIn general, HHN frequently promotes Anti-Vaccination propaganda and consistently insists on a link between Autism and vaccines, which is not supported by science. HHN also rejects the consensus of science regarding chemtrails and Gmo’s. They also promote conspiracy theories such as the Government suppressing cures for cancer to control population. Lastly, Erin Elizabeth dreamed up a conspiracy theory that holistic Doctors are being killed, supposedly by the pharmaceutical industry. Needless to say this has been thoroughly debunked.\nOverall, we rate Health Nut News a Tin Foil Hat Conspiracy and Quackery level Pseudoscience website based on frequent publication of misleading, unproven or out right false claims regarding health and medicine.

Avocados are a great food source and loaded with plenty of nutrients, but this misleading headline does not match the article. MindBodyGreen also does not support the consensus of science when it comes to GMO’s as most articles paint them in a negative light.

According to their about page on Facebook they were founded in 2012. RealFarmacy has been routinely criticized for promotion of pseudoscience.\nFunded by / Ownership\nRealFarmacy is not transparent in its ownership. The website is funded through online advertising.\nAnalysis / Bias\nIn review, RealFarmacy is a health news website that promotes both conspiracies and mostly pseudoscience. For example, many articles on this website promote anti-Vaccination propaganda such as this: Proof That It Is Actually Vaccinated People Who Are Spreading Communicable Disease. This article cites the credible Kaiser Health News and then turns to right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for analysis. RealFarmacy also publishes miracle cancer cures and prevention such as this: Manuka Honey: Improves Sleep, Boosts Immunity, Prevents Cancer, and Is a Natural Antibiotic. In case you were wondering, there isn’t evidence that Manuka Honey prevents cancer. Some other Pseudoscience topics you will find on RealFarmacy is humans being poisoned by chem trails, Fluoride alarmism and most commonly how deadly GMO’s are to humans. In general, this site disrespects science to such a degree it is less than non-credible.\nA factual search reveals too many failed checks to list.\nOverall, we rate RealFarmacy a Quackery level Pseudoscience website for the promotion of anti-vaccination propaganda, as well as dangerous miracle cures for cancer and a complete rejection of science on all levels.

Our leaders perfectly fit the description of Israel’s leaders given in Ezekiel chapter 34. The New World Order and our government (if indeed there is a difference) are counting on the fact that most people are really sheep. We are ignorant and easily led – and in many cases we even finance and bring about our own destruction! In an effort to wake people up to the many realities that could easily point to our doom, this website is being designed to expose the Global Elite’s agenda for stripping you of your rights, your money, your property, your privacy and ultimately for the total depopulation of the earth down to a number (500 million) that can easily be controlled to do their bidding. That may sound crazy at first glance. Once, we thought so too. Until our eyes were opened.”\nFunded by / Ownership\nThe blog does not list ownership nor any names associated with the website.

For example, in this anti-vaccination article they use fear to persuade people not to vaccinate their children. The article attempts to convince people that more children are vaccine damaged in the USA than children in Syria have been damaged by chemical weapons. This article provides zero evidence to support that more children are injured by vaccines. There is not a single statistic from a reliable source to support this claim. They do however, claim that the Syrian bombing by the USA was a False flag operation. In fact, the article cites Natural News as it’s primary source for information. Natural News is a well know purveyor of pseudoscience, conspiracies and fake news. Within this same article they cite a source called CDC.news, which is meant to look like an official CDC page, but in fact is owned by Natural News for the purpose of discrediting the CDC. At least they put a disclaimer on the CDC.news page that it is not affiliated with the credible Centers for Disease Control.\nIn another article they claim that Cannabis Oil cured a girls Leukemia, even though she had already undergone Chemotherapy. Again, there is zero evidence to prove it was the cannabis oil that cured her. It is simply unproven. Virtually all known conspiracies are covered by this site: Chemtrails, New World Order, False Flag, Aliens, etc. This source also promotes Pseudosciences such as miracle cures with natural products and anti-GMO propaganda. On the bright side they do appear to support the scientific consensus that climate change is human influenced. (2/3/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/15/2017)\nReview 2: Anti-Vaccine:  Article about anti-expert.\nhttp://www.wakingtimes.com/2017/08/09/not-trust-medical-experts/\nThe article makes claims that are backed up only by linking to clearly biased sites that are also anti-vaccine. Claiming to not ask experts and to instead do the research yourself is fine if you research things objectively, which the article fails to do. Objectivity is the ability to change your currently held belief that something is X when presented with evidence that it is not.\n“Vaccines, historically, were NEVER crucial in protecting ANY form of society, “developed” or otherwise.”  Taken directly from the article, this references nothing to back this claim up and then moves on to keep citing the same clearly biased site.  There’s ample historical evidence that Vaccines helped save people from several major diseases and are easily verifiable by reading any number of scientific and historical works online.  Polio is probably the biggest one followed by Measles and Small Pox.\nhttp://www.wakingtimes.com/2017/08/09/occult-secrets-language-method-mind-control/\nTHE OCCULT SECRETS OF LANGUAGE AS A METHOD OF MIND CONTROL –  There’s little if anything to research here other than pure conspiracy level nonsense used to further scare up ad views on the page.\nI would argue the authors of this site are neither left or right. They view taxation as theft, government as intrusive, anti-vaccine, anti-GMO, belief in supernatural, anti-foreign intervention, anti-alcohol, anti-pharma, anti-muslim, anti-fracking, pro-weed, pro-spirit, pro-natural the list goes on. They are anarcho-libertarian. (M. Allen 8/15/2017)\nReview 3: Waking times (WT) is a predominantly conspiracy / pseudoscience site. The stories are primarily a rehash of the standard Illuminati / New World Order / Big Brother conspiracies that have been around for centuries. As is typical for similar sites, WT takes a grain of truth or unrelated facts and runs directly into pure speculation. While there are some people, groups, and organizations that control a large portion of the wealth in the world, there is no credible information linking them into some vast conspiracy to control the world. While the stories do contain some links to credible sources, the conclusions drawn by WT do not match the information in the links.\nFor example: In the story titled “New GM Crops Use Rna Interference Technology For Mass Sterilization” the title leaves the distinct impression that the subjects being sterilized are humans. Which is not the case. In fairness the story does present solid links to research and studies on using plants to sterilize specific insects that are harmful to crops. The story also, however, implies that such modifications can be passed on to humans, for which there is no credible evidence of that happening. In one statement the story claims that “In humans, it is likely that GMOS cause significant changes in, endocrine meatbolism, and cause endometriosis , which leads to more miscarriages and birth defects.” Yet the article cited gives no specific evidence of human sterilization, and even stresses that the possibility is hypothetical.\nThe cited report also only deals with human sterilization from existing GMO’s, and does not address the current research on sterilization of insects. So implying that human sterilization from the current research is likely based on an unrelated study is, again, purely hypothetical.\nLastly, while further study, research and testing is always recommended, to date no direct link between GMO’s and any of the medical problems ascribed to them exists.\nThis is just one example, yet the majority of the stories on WT are in a similar vein. Some of the stories, such as the anti-vaxx stories, as documented by other MBFC reviewers, could pose a health risk to the public, which is irresponsible and ill-advised at best. For all of the above, WT is rated Conspiracy / Pseudoscience. (D. Kelley 08/16/17)\nSummary: Overall, we rate Waking Times a Strong Conspiracy and Quackery level pseudoscience website.

In fact, Factcheck.org calls them a “disreputable news site” and “Fake News.”\nA factual search of IFCN fact checkers lists too many failed fact checks to detail.\nOverall, WhatDoesItMean.com is a Conspiracy-Pseudoscience site that is beyond Tin Foil Hat. This would make Alex Jones cringe. (10/26/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 7/12/2018)",

Anything that is said on the show is for information purposes only.” A Whois search reveals the site was launched in 2008.\nFunded by / Ownership\nX22 is funded through a combination of online ads and many prominent donate buttons. They also accept cryptocurrencies. The site appears to be owned by a single person named Dave. He does not provide his last name.\nAnalysis / Bias\nThe focus of X22 is on the potential for an economic melt down where inflation drives the cost of goods to unaffordable levels. In fact, X22 provides a list of prepping materials needed for this collapse. These include: food, water, toilet supplies, weapons, ammunition, gold and silver etc. X22 also believes that climate change is a hoax. The wording of headlines and articles contain only mild loaded words, however they consistently use questionable sources such as conspiracy theorist Ben Swann and Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog. X22 also has a page dedicated to Relocations of Unaccompanied Immigrant Minors, which provides a map of where they are most concentrated in the USA. There isn’t a description as to why this map is posted. Do they have sympathy for the immigrant minors? Or is it a warning? Based on the comments below the map it appears that the readers are opposed to immigrants, with some fearing spread of diseases.\nOverall, X22 Report is a strong Conspiracy website that promotes unproven claims.

Headlines use loaded emotional language such as this: I Was In The Illuminati I’m Going To Tell You Everything, Shocking Expose. Politically, story selection almost always favors the right through negative stories regarding liberal policy and politicians such as this: CIA Insider: Hillary Clinton Most Treasonous Leader In History.\nYourNewsWire publishes anti-vaccination propaganda, stories of impending world war 3 and extraterrestrial stories, just to name a few. Further, YourNewsWire has made Factcheck.org’s fake news list. as well as having an abysmal track record with fact checkers. Finally, according to Poynter Institute, YourNewsWire has more false claims by IFCN fact checkers than any other website.\nOverall, we rate YourNewsWire a Tin Foil Hat level conspiracy website that has zero credibility due to routine publishing of fake news.

According to a Bloomberg Interview the Zero Hedge founders/authors were anonymous until 2016. A Professional Service Subscription is required to read the rest of the interview from Bloomberg, however a New Yorker article also covered their history.\nZero Hedge wrote a rebuttal article regarding the Bloomberg interview that can be found here.

Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry= dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft.” \nZero Hedge’s content has been classified as “alt-right” and has been criticized for presenting conspiracy theories.\nIn review, Zero Hedge publishes pro-right wing/Trump articles such as Pat Buchanan: “Trump Calls Off Cold War II.” As well as fake news stories regarding liberals: Anti-Trump Protesters Bused Into Austin, Chicago.\nEditorial content is written under the pseudonym Tyler Durden and usually focuses on conspiracies related to economic collapse. Zero Hedge sources to factually mixed think tanks such as the The Mises Institute, which promotes Austrian (Anarcho-Capitalism) economics.\nA factual search reveals a terrible track record with IFCN fact checkers.
